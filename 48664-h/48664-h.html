        Julius Constantius and nephew of the Emperor Constantine, was born at
        Constantinople in 331 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> His father, eldest
        brother, and cousins were slain in the massacre by which Constantius,
        Constantine II., and Constans secured the empire for themselves on
        the death of their father Constantine in 337. Julian and his elder
        brother Gallus spent a precarious childhood and youth, of which six
        years were passed in close confinement in the remote castle of
        Macellum in Cappadocia, and their position was hardly more secure
        when, in 350, Gallus was elevated to the Caesarship by Constantius,
        who, after the violent deaths of his two brothers, was now sole ruler
        of the empire. But Julian was allowed to pursue his favourite studies
        in Greek literature and philosophy, partly at Nicomedia and Athens,
        partly in the cities <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pageviii">[pg
        viii]</span><a name="Pgviii" id="Pgviii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        of Asia Minor, and he was deeply influenced by Maximus of Ephesus,
        the occult philosopher, Libanius of Nicomedia, the fashionable
        sophist, and Themistius the Aristotelian commentator, the only
        genuine philosopher among the sophists of the fourth century
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the excesses
        of the revolutionary Gallus ended in his death at the hands of
        Constantius, Julian, an awkward and retiring student, was summoned to
        the court at Milan, where he was protected by the Empress Eusebia
        from the suspicions of Constantius and the intrigues of hostile
        courtiers. Constantius had no heir to continue the dynasty of the
        Constantii. He therefore raised Julian to the Caesarship in 355, gave
        him his sister Helena in marriage, and dispatched him to Gaul to
        pacify the Gallic provinces. To the surprise of all, Julian in four
        successive campaigns against the Franks and the Alemanis proved
        himself a good soldier and a popular general. His <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Commentaries</span></span> on these campaigns
        are praised by Eunapius<a id="noteref_2" name="noteref_2" href=
        "#note_2"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span></a> and
        Libanius,<a id="noteref_3" name="noteref_3" href=
        "#note_3"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3</span></span></a> but are
        not now extant. In 357-358 Constantius, who was occupied by wars
        against the Quadi and the Sarmatians, and threatened with a renewal
        of hostilities by the Persian king Sapor, ordered Julian,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pageix">[pg ix]</span><a name="Pgix" id=
        "Pgix" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> who was then at Paris, to send to
        his aid the best of the Gallic legions. Julian would have obeyed, but
        his troops, unwilling to take service in the East, mutinied and
        proclaimed him Emperor (359 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>). Julian issued
        manifestoes justifying his conduct to the Senates of Rome and Athens
        and to the Spartans and Corinthians, a characteristic anachronism,
        since their opinion no longer had any weight. It was not till 361
        that he began his march eastward to encounter the army of
        Constantius. His troops, though seasoned and devoted, were in numbers
        no match for the legions of his cousin. But the latter, while
        marching through Cilicia to oppose his advance, died suddenly of a
        fever near Tarsus, and Julian, now in his thirtieth year, succeeded
        peacefully to the throne and made a triumphal entry into
        Constantinople in December, 361.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The eunuchs and
        courtiers who had surrounded Constantius were replaced by sophists
        and philosophers, and in the next six months Julian set on foot
        numerous economic and administrative reforms. He had long been
        secretly devoted to the Pagan religion, and he at once proclaimed the
        restoration of the Pagan gods and the temple worship. Christianity he
        tolerated, and in his brief reign of sixteen months the Christians
        were not actively persecuted. His <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "pagex">[pg x]</span><a name="Pgx" id="Pgx" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> treatise <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Against the Christians</span></span>, which
        survives only in fragments, was an explanation of his apostasy. The
        epithet <span class="tei tei-q">“Apostate”</span> was bestowed on him
        by the Christian Fathers. Meanwhile he was preparing—first at
        Constantinople then at Antioch, where he wrote the <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Misopogon</span></span>, a satire on the luxury
        and frivolity of the inhabitants—for a campaign against Sapor, a task
        which he had inherited from Constantius. In March, 362 he left
        Antioch and crossed the Euphrates, visited Carrhae, memorable for the
        defeat of Crassus, then crossed the Tigris, and, after burning his
        fleet, retired northwards towards Armenia. On the march he fought an
        indecisive battle with the Persians at Maranga, and in a skirmish
        with the retreating enemy he was mortally wounded by a javelin
        (January 26th, 363). His body was carried to Tarsus by his successor
        the Emperor Jovian, and was probably removed later to Constantinople.
        The legend that as he died he exclaimed: Γαλιλαῖε νενίκηκας,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou hast conquered, O Galilæan!”</span>
        appears first in the Christian historian Theodoret in the fifth
        century. Julian was the last male descendant of the famous dynasty
        founded by Constantius Chlorus.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In spite of his
        military achievements, he was, first of all, a student. Even on his
        campaigns he took his <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexi">[pg
        xi]</span><a name="Pgxi" id="Pgxi" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> books
        with him, and several of his extant works were composed in camp. He
        had been trained, according to the fashion of his times, in
        rhetorical studies by professional sophists such as Libanius, and he
        has all the mannerisms of a fourth century sophist. It was the
        sophistic etiquette to avoid the direct use of names, and Julian
        never names the usurpers Magnentius, Silvanus, and Vetranio, whose
        suppression by Constantius he describes in his two first <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Orations</span></span>,
        regularly refers to Sapor as <span class="tei tei-q">“the
        barbarian,”</span> and rather than name Mardonius, his tutor, calls
        him <span class="tei tei-q">“a certain Scythian who had the same name
        as the man who persuaded Xerxes to invade Hellas.”</span><a id=
        "noteref_4" name="noteref_4" href="#note_4"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">4</span></span></a> He wrote
        the literary Greek of the fourth century <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> which imitates the
        classical style, though barbarisms and late constructions are never
        entirely avoided. His pages are crowded with echoes of Homer,
        Demosthenes, Plato, and Isocrates, and his style is interwoven with
        half verses, phrases, and whole sentences taken without
        acknowledgment from the Greek masterpieces. It is certain that, like
        other sophists, he wished his readers to recognise these echoes, and
        therefore his source is always classical, so that where he seems to
        imitate Dio Chrysostom or Themistius, both go back to a common
        source, which <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexii">[pg
        xii]</span><a name="Pgxii" id="Pgxii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        Julian had in mind. Another sophistic element in his style is the use
        of commonplaces, literary allusions that had passed into the
        sophistic language and can be found in all the writers of
        reminiscence Greek in his day. He himself derides this practice<a id=
        "noteref_5" name="noteref_5" href="#note_5"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">5</span></span></a> but he
        cannot resist dragging in the well-worn references to Cyrus, Darius,
        and Alexander, to the nepenthe poured out by Helen in the
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Odyssey</span></span>, to the defiance of nature
        by Xerxes, or the refusal of Socrates to admit the happiness of the
        Great King. Julian wished to make Neo-Platonism the philosophy of his
        revived Hellenism, but he belonged to the younger or Syrian branch of
        the school, of which Iamblichus was the real founder, and he only
        once mentions Plotinus. Iamblichus he ranked with Plato and paid him
        a fanatical devotion. His philosophical writing, especially in the
        two prose <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Hymns</span></span>, is obscure, partly because
        his theories are only vaguely realised, partly because he reproduces
        the obscurity of his model, Iamblichus. In satire and narrative he
        can be clear and straightforward.</p>

        desired, most mighty Emperor, to sing the praises of your valour and

        of arms. But the vast scale of your exploits deterred me, because
        what I had to dread was not that my words would fall somewhat short
        of your achievements, but that I should prove wholly unequal to my
        theme. That men versed in political debate, or poets, should find it
        easy to compose a panegyric on your career is not at all surprising.
        Their practice in speaking, their habit of declaiming in public
        supplies them abundantly with a well-warranted confidence. But those
        who have neglected this field and chosen another branch of literary
        study which devotes itself to a form of composition little adapted to
        win popular favour and that has not the hardihood to exhibit itself
        in its nakedness in every theatre, no matter what, would naturally
        hesitate to make speeches of the epideictic sort. As for the poets,
        their Muse, and the general belief that it is she who inspires their
        verse, obviously gives them unlimited license to invent. To
        rhetoricians the art of rhetoric allows just as much freedom; fiction
        is denied them, but flattery is by no means forbidden, nor is it
        counted a disgrace to the orator that the object of his panegyric
        should not deserve it. Poets who compose and publish some legend that
        no one had thought of before increase their reputation, because an
        audience is entertained by the mere fact of novelty. Orators, again,
        assert<a id="noteref_11" name="noteref_11" href=
        "#note_11"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">11</span></span></a> that the
        advantage of their art is that it can treat a slight theme in the
        grand manner, and again, by the use of mere words, strip the
        greatness from deeds, and, in short, marshall the power of words
        against that of facts.)</p>

        devote themselves to literature attempt to sing your praises in verse

        Some did not shrink from the tremendous effort to secure every one of
        your achievements from the withering touch of time; others, because
        they foresaw that they could not compass the whole, expressed
        themselves only in part, and chose to consecrate to you their
        individual work so far as they were able. Better this, they thought,

        incline your ear to my words and not play the part of a severe and
        inexorable critic. But since, bred as I have been and educated in
        other studies, other pursuits, other conventions, I am criticised for

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(There is an
        ancient maxim taught by him who first introduced philosophy to
        mankind, and it is as follows. All who aspire to virtue and the
        beautiful must study in their words, deeds, conversation, in short,
        in all the affairs of life, great and small, to aim in every way at
        beauty. Now what sensible man would deny that virtue is of all things
        the most beautiful? Wherefore those are bidden to lay firm hold on
        her who do not seek to blazon abroad her name in vain, appropriating
        that which in no way belongs to them. Now in giving this counsel, the
        maxim does not prescribe any single type of discourse, nor does it
        proclaim to its readers, like a god from the machine in tragedy,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Ye must aspire to virtue and eschew
        evil.”</span> Many are the paths that it allows a man to follow to
        this goal, if he desire to imitate the nature of the beautiful. For
        example, he may give good advice, or use hortatory discourse, or he
        may rebuke error without malice, or applaud what is well done, or
        condemn, on occasion, what is ill done. It permits men also to use
        other types of oratory, if they please, so as to attain the best end
        of speech, but it enjoins on them to take thought in every word and
        act how they shall give account of all they utter, and to speak no
        word that cannot be referred to the standard of virtue and
        philosophy. That and more to the same effect is the tenour of that
        precept.)</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page010">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(And now, what am
        I to do? What embarrasses me is the fact that, if I praise you, I
        shall be thought simply to curry favour, and in fact, the department
        of panegyric has come to incur a grave suspicion due to its misuse,
        and is now held to be base flattery rather than trustworthy testimony
        to heroic deeds. Is it not obvious that I must put my faith in the
        merit of him whom I undertake to praise, and with full confidence
        devote my energies to this panegyric? What then shall be the prelude
        of my speech and the most suitable arrangement? Assuredly I must
        begin with the virtues of your ancestors through which it was
        possible for you to come to be what you are. Next I think it will be
        proper to describe your upbringing and education, since these
        contributed very much to the noble qualities that you possess, and
        when I have dealt with all these, I must recount your achievements,
        the signs and tokens, as it were, of the nobility of your soul, and
        finally, as the crown and consummation of my discourse, I shall set
        forth those personal qualities from which was evolved all that was
        noble in your projects and their execution. It is in this respect
        that I think my speech will surpass those of all the others. For some
        limit themselves to your exploits, with the idea that a description
        of these suffices for a perfect panegyric, but for my part I think
        one ought to devote the greater part of one's speech to the virtues
        that were the stepping-stones by which you reached the height of your
        achievements. Military exploits in most cases, nay in almost all, are
        achieved with the help of fortune, the body-guard, heavy infantry and
        cavalry regiments. But virtuous actions belong to the doer alone, and
        the praise that they inspire, if it be sincere, belongs only to the
        possessor of such virtue. Now, having made this distinction clear, I
        will begin my speech.)</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page012">[pg

        panegyric require that I should mention your native land no less than
        your ancestors. But I am at a loss what country I ought to consider
        peculiarly yours. For countless nations have long asserted their
        claim to be your country. The city<a id="noteref_23" name=
        "noteref_23" href="#note_23"><span class=

        rules over them all was your mother and nurse, and in an auspicious
        hour delivered to you the imperial sceptre, and therefore asserts her
        sole title to the honour, and that not merely by resorting to the
        plea that has prevailed under all the emperors. I mean that, even if
        men are born elsewhere, they all adopt her constitution and use the
        laws and customs that she has promulgated, and by that fact become
        Roman citizens. But her claim is different, namely that she gave your
        mother birth, rearing her royally and as befitted the offspring who
        were to be born to her. Then again, the city on the Bosporus which is
        named after the family of the Constantii, though she does not assert
        that she is your native place, but acknowledges that she became your
        adopted land by your father's act, will think she is cheated of her
        rights if any orator should try to deprive her of at least this claim
        to kinship. Thirdly, the Illyrians, on whose soil you were born, will
        not tolerate it if anyone assign you a different fatherland and rob
        them of the fairest gift of fortune. And now I hear some even of the
        Eastern provinces protest that it is unjust of me to rob them of the
        lustre they derive from you. For they say that they sent forth your
        grandmother to be the consort of your grandfather on the mother's
        side. Almost all the rest have hit on some pretension of more or less
        weight, and are determined, on one ground or another, to adopt you
        for their own. Therefore let that country<a id="noteref_24" name=
        "noteref_24" href="#note_24"><span class=

        prize which you yourself prefer and have so often praised as the
        mother and teacher of the virtues; as for the rest, let each one
        according to her deserts obtain her due. I should be glad to praise
        them all, worthy as they are of glory and honour, but I am afraid
        that my compliments, however germane they may seem to my subject,
        might, on account of their length, be thought inappropriate to the
        present occasion. For this reason, then, I think it better to omit a
        eulogy of the others, but as for Rome, your imperial Majesty summed
        up her praises in two words when you called her the teacher of
        virtue, and, by bestowing on her the fairest of all encomiums, you
        have forestalled all that others might say. What praise of mine would
        come up to that? What indeed is left for anyone to say? So I feel
        that I, who naturally hold that city in reverence, shall pay her a
        higher honour if I leave her praise in your hands.)</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(Now perhaps I
        ought at this point to say a few words about your noble ancestors.
        Only that here too I am at a loss where to begin. For all your
        ancestors, grandfathers, parents, brothers, cousins and kinsfolk were
        emperors, who had either acquired their power by lawful means or were
        adopted by the reigning house. Why should I recall ancient history or
        hark back to Claudius and produce proofs of his merit, which are
        manifest and known to all? To what end recount his campaigns against
        the barbarians across the Danube or how righteously and justly he won
        the empire? How plainly he lived while on the throne! How simple was
        his dress, as may be seen to this day in his statues! What I might
        say about your grandparents<a id="noteref_27" name="noteref_27" href=
        "#note_27"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">27</span></span></a> is
        comparatively recent, but equally remarkable. Both of them acquired
        the imperial sceptre as the reward of conspicuous merit, and having
        assumed the command, they were on such good terms with each other and
        displayed such filial piety to him<a id="noteref_28" name=
        "noteref_28" href="#note_28"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">28</span></span></a> who had
        granted them a share in the empire, that he used to say that of all
        the safeguards designed by him for the realm, and they were many,
        this was his master-stroke. They, meanwhile, valued their mutual
        understanding more than undivided empire, supposing that it could
        have been bestowed on either of them separately. This was the temper
        of their souls, and nobly they played their part in action, while
        next to the Supreme Being they reverenced him who had placed
        authority in their hands. With their subjects they dealt righteously
        and humanely, and expelled the barbarians who had for years settled
        in our territory and had occupied it with impunity as though it were
        their own, and they built forts to hinder encroachment, which
        procured for those subjects such peaceful relations with the
        barbarians as, at that period, seemed to be beyond their dreams.
        This, however, is a subject that deserves more than a passing
        mention. Yet it would be wrong to omit the strongest proof of their
        unanimity, especially as it is related to my subject. Since they
        desired the most perfect harmony for their children, they arranged
        the marriage of your father and mother.<a id="noteref_29" name=
        "noteref_29" href="#note_29"><span class=

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">29</span></span></a> On this
        point also I think I must say a few words to show that virtue was
        bequeathed to you as well as a throne. But why waste time in telling
        how your father, on his father's death, became emperor both by the
        choice of the deceased monarch and by the vote of all the armies? His
        military genius was made evident by his achievements and needs no
        words of mine. He traversed the whole civilised world suppressing
        tyrants, but never those who ruled by right. His subjects he inspired
        with such affection that his veterans still remember how generous he
        was with largess and other rewards, and to this day worship him as
        though he were a god. As for the mass of the people, in town and
        country alike, they prayed that your father might be victorious over
        the tyrants, not so much because they would be delivered from that
        oppression as because they would then be governed by him. But when he
        had made his power supreme, he found that the tyrant's<a id=

        had worked like a drought, with the result that money was very
        scarce, while there were great hoards of treasure in the recesses of
        the palace; so he unlocked its doors and on the instant flooded the
        whole country with wealth, and then, in less than ten years, he
        founded and gave his name to a city<a id="noteref_31" name=

        far surpasses all others as it is itself inferior to Rome; and to
        come second to Rome seems to me a much greater honour than to be
        counted first and foremost of all cities beside. Here it may be
        proper to mention Athens <span class="tei tei-q">“the
        illustrious,”</span><a id="noteref_32" name="noteref_32" href=
        "#note_32"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">32</span></span></a> seeing
        that during his whole life he honoured her in word and deed. He who
        was emperor and lord of all did not disdain the title of General of
        the Athenians, and when they gave him a statue with an inscription to
        that effect he felt more pride than if he had been awarded the
        highest honours. To repay Athens for this compliment he bestowed on
        her annually a gift of many tens of thousands of bushels of wheat, so
        that while she enjoyed plenty, he won applause and reverence from the
        best of men.)</p>

        begat, reared and educated you. This secured to the rest of the world
        the advantages of good government, and that not for a limited time
        but for a period beyond his own lifetime, as far as this is possible.
        At any rate your father seems still to be on the throne. This is more
        than Cyrus himself could achieve. When he died his son proved far
        inferior, so that while men called Cyrus <span class=

        ancestry was so distinguished, her personal beauty and nobility of
        character were such that it would be hard to find her match among
        women. I have heard that saying of the Persians about Parysatis, that
        no other woman had been the sister, mother, wife, and daughter of
        kings. Parysatis, however, was own sister of her husband, since their
        law does not forbid a Persian to marry his sister. But your mother,
        while in accordance with our laws she kept pure and unsullied those
        ties of kinship, was actually the daughter of one emperor,<a id=

        frontiers safe from the enemy's incursions, and often led his forces
        against them in person, so long at least as he was permitted by those
        who were so soon punished for their crimes against him. Though by the
        number and brilliance of their achievements they have indeed earned
        our homage, and though all the blessings of fortune were theirs in
        abundance, yet in the whole tale of their felicity one could pay them
        no greater compliment than merely to name their sires and grandsires.
        But I must not make my account of them too long, lest I should spend
        time that I ought to devote to your own panegyric. So in what follows
        I will, as indeed I ought, endeavour—or rather, since affectation is

        capital, and Alexander, Philip's son, and the like, I purposely
        ignore them. Indeed I feel that poetic license accounts for them all.
        And it is foolish even to state that at the hour of your birth all
        the circumstances were brilliant and suited to a prince. And now the
        time has come for me to speak of your education as a boy. You were of
        course bound to have the princely nurture that should train your body
        to be strong, muscular, healthy, and handsome, and at the same time
        duly equip your soul with courage, justice, temperance, and wisdom.
        But this cannot result from that loose indulgence which naturally
        pampers body and soul, weakening men's wills for facing danger and
        their bodies for work. Therefore your body required training by
        suitable gymnastics, while you adorned your mind by literary studies.
        But I must speak at greater length about both branches of your
        education, since it laid the foundation of your later career. In your
        physical training you did not pursue those exercises that fit one
        merely for public display. What professional athletes love to call
        the pink of condition you thought unsuitable for a king who must
        enter for contests that are not make-believe. Such a one must put up
        with very little sleep and scanty food, and that of no precise
        quantity or quality or served at regular hours, but such as can be
        had when the stress of work allows. And so you thought you ought to
        train yourself in athletics with a view to this, and that your
        exercises must be military and of many kinds, dancing and running in
        heavy armour, and riding. All these you have continued from early
        youth to practise at the right time, and in every exercise you have
        attained to greater perfection than any other hoplite. Usually a
        hoplite who is a good infantryman cannot ride, or, if he is an expert
        horseman, he shirks marching on foot to battle. But of you alone it
        can be said that you can put on the cavalry uniform and be a match
        for the best of them, and when changed into a hoplite show yourself
        stronger, swifter, and lighter on your feet than all the rest. Then
        you practised shooting at a mark, that even your hours of leisure
        might not be hours of ease or be found without the exercise of arms.
        So by work that was voluntary you trained your body to stand the
        exertions that you would be compelled to undertake. Your mind,
        meanwhile, was trained by practice in public speaking and other
        studies suitable to your years. But it was not to be wholly without
        the discipline of experience, nor was it for you to listen merely to
        lectures on the virtues as though they were ballads or saga stories,
        and so wait all that time without actual acquaintance with brave
        works and undertakings. Plato, that noble philosopher, advised<a id=
        "noteref_49" name="noteref_49" href="#note_49"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">49</span></span></a> that
        boys should be furnished as it were with wings for flight by being
        mounted on horseback, and should then be taken into battle so that
        they may be spectators of the warfare in which they must soon be
        combatants. This, I make bold to say, was in your father's mind when
        he made you governor and king of the Celtic tribes while you were
        still a youth, or rather a mere boy in point of years, though in
        intelligence and endurance you could already hold your own with men
        of parts. Your father wisely provided that your experience of war
        should be free from risks, having arranged that the barbarians should
        maintain peace with his subjects. But he instigated them to internal
        feuds and civil war, and so taught you strategy at the expense of
        their lives and fortunes. This was a safer policy than the wise
        Plato's. For, by his scheme, if the invading army were composed of
        infantry, the boys could indeed be spectators of their fathers'
        prowess, or, if need arose, could even take part. But supposing that
        the enemy won in a cavalry engagement, then, on the instant, one
        would have to devise some means to save the boys, which would be
        difficult indeed. But to inure the boys to face the enemy, while the
        hazard belongs to others, is to take counsel that both suffices for
        their need and also secures their safety.)</p>

        self-sufficing guide. But also, I think, the wisest citizens were at
        your disposal and gave you lessons in statecraft. Moreover, your
        intercourse with the barbarian leaders in that region gave you an
        acquaintance at first hand with the manners, laws, and usages of
        foreigners. Indeed, when Homer set out to prove the consummate wisdom
        of Odysseus, he called him <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“much-travelled,”</span> and said that he had come to
        know the minds of many peoples and visited their cities, so that he
        might choose what was best in every one and be able to mix with all
        sorts and conditions of men. Yes, even Odysseus, who never ruled an
        empire, needed experience of the many and divers minds of men. How
        much more necessary that one who was being brought up to guide an
        empire like this should not fit himself for the task in some modest
        dwelling apart; neither should he, like young Cyrus in his games,
        play at being emperor, nor give audiences to his playmates, as they
        say<a id="noteref_52" name="noteref_52" href="#note_52"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        did. Rather he ought to mix with nations and peoples, and give orders
        to his troops definitely indicating what is to be done, and generally
        he should be found wanting in none of those things which, when he
        comes to manhood, he must perform without fear.)</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(Accordingly, when
        you had gained a thorough knowledge of the Celts, you crossed to the
        other continent and were given sole command against the Parthians and
        Medes. There were already signs that a war was smouldering and would
        soon burst into flame. You therefore quickly learned how to deal with
        it, and, as though you took as model the hardness of your weapons,
        steeled yourself to bear the heat of the summer season. I have heard
        say that Alcibiades alone, among all the Greeks, was naturally so
        versatile that when he cast in his lot with the Spartans he copied
        the self-restraint of the Lacedaemonians, then in turn Theban and
        Thracian manners, and finally adopted Persian luxury. But Alcibiades,
        when he changed his country changed his character<a id="noteref_62"
        name="noteref_62" href="#note_62"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">62</span></span></a> too, and
        became so tainted with perversity and so ill-conditioned that he was
        likely to lose utterly all that he was born to. You, however, thought
        it your duty to maintain your severity of life wherever you might be,
        and by hard work inuring your constitution to change, you easily bore
        the march inland from Galatia to Parthia, more easily in fact than a
        rich man who lives now here, now there, according to the season,
        would bear it if he were forced to encounter unseasonable weather. I
        think Heaven smiled on you and willed that you should govern the
        whole world, and so from the first trained you in virtue, and was
        your guide when you journeyed to all points, and showed you the
        bounds and limits of the whole empire, the character of each region,
        the vastness of your territory, the power of every race, the number
        of the cities, the characteristics of the masses, and above all the
        vast number of things that one who is bred to so great a kingship
        cannot afford to neglect. But I nearly forgot to mention the most
        important thing of all. From a boy you were taught to govern this
        great empire, but a better thing you learned, to be governed,
        submitting yourself to the authority that is the best in the world
        and the most just, that is to say nature and law. I mean that both as
        son and subject you obeyed your father. Indeed, had he been only your
        father or only your king, obedience was his due. Now what rearing and
        education for a king could one find in history better than this?
        Consider the Greeks. Not thus did the Spartans train the Heracleidae,
        though they are thought to have enjoyed the best form of government,
        that of their kings. As for the barbarians, not even the
        Carthaginians, though they were particularly well-governed by their
        kings, chose the best method of training their future rulers. The
        moral discipline and the studies prescribed by their laws were
        pursued by all alike, as though the citizens were brothers, all
        destined both to govern and be governed, and in the matter of
        education they made no difference between their princes and the rest
        of the citizens. Yet surely it is foolish to demand superlative
        excellence from one's rulers when one takes no pains to make them
        better than other men. Among the barbarians, indeed, no man is
        debarred from winning the throne, so one can excuse them for giving
        the same moral training to all. But that Lycurgus, who tried to make
        the dynasty of the Heracleidae proof against all shocks,<a id=
        "noteref_63" name="noteref_63" href="#note_63"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">63</span></span></a> should
        not have arranged for them a special education better than that of
        other Spartan youths is an omission for which he may well be
        criticised. He may have thought that all the Lacedaemonians ought to
        enter the race for virtue, and foster it, but for all that it was
        wrong to provide the same nurture and education for private citizens
        as for those who were to govern. The inevitable familiarity little by
        little steals into men's souls and breeds contempt for their betters.
        Though, for that matter, they are not in any sense one's betters
        unless it was their own merit that earned them the right to rule.
        This, in my opinion, is the reason why the Spartan kings often found
        their subjects hard to govern. In proof of what I say one might quote
        the rivalry of Lysander and Agesilaus, and many other instances, if
        one should review the history of the Spartan kings.)</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(The Spartan
        polity, however, by securing a satisfactory development of the moral
        qualities in their kings, even if it gave them a training in no way
        different from that of the crowd, at least endowed them with the
        attributes of well-bred men. But as for the Carthaginians, there was
        nothing to admire even in the discipline that they all shared. The
        parents turned their sons out of doors and bade them win the
        necessaries of life by their own efforts, with the injunction to do
        nothing that is considered disgraceful. The effect of this was not to
        uproot the evil inclinations of the young, but to require them to
        take pains not to be caught in wrong-doing. For it is not
        self-indulgence only that ruins character, but the lack of mere
        necessaries may produce the same result. This is true at any rate in
        the case of those whose reason has not yet assumed the power to
        decide, being swayed by physical needs and persuaded by desire. It is
        especially true when one fails to control the passion for
        money-getting, if from boyhood one is accustomed to it and to the
        trading and bartering of the market-places. This business, unfit for
        a youth of gentle birth to mention, or so much as hear spoken of,
        whether the youth finds it out for himself or learns it from those of
        greater experience, leaves many scars on the soul; and even a
        respectable citizen ought to be free from all this, not a king or
        general alone.)</p>

        result of obedience to the laws; you enjoy a body of unusual strength
        by reason of your self-control, and a soul of unusual rectitude
        because of your physical powers of endurance. You left nothing undone
        to improve your natural talents, but ever acquired new talents by new
        studies. You needed nothing yourself but gave assistance to others,
        and lavished such generous gifts that the recipients seemed as rich
        as the monarch of the Lydians.<a id="noteref_70" name="noteref_70"

        you indulged yourself less in the good things that were yours than
        the most austere of the Spartans, you gave others the means of luxury
        in abundance, while those who preferred temperance could imitate your
        example. As a ruler you were mild and humane; as your father's
        subject you were ever as modest as any one of his people. All this
        was true of you in boyhood and youth, and much more about which there
        is now no time to speak at length.)</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        postpone the description of your personal qualities and go on to
        speak of your achievements. The Persians in the past conquered the
        whole of Asia, subjugated a great part of Europe, and had embraced in
        their hopes I may almost say the whole inhabited world, when the
        Macedonians deprived them of their supremacy, and they provided
        Alexander's generalship with a task, or rather with a toy. But they
        could not endure the yoke of slavery, and no sooner was Alexander
        dead, than they revolted from his successors and once more opposed
        their power to the Macedonians, and so successfully that, when we
        took over what was left of the Macedonian empire, we counted them to
        the end as foes with whom we must reckon. I need not now remind you
        of ancient history, of Antony and Crassus,<a id="noteref_80" name=
        "noteref_80" href="#note_80"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        generals with the fullest powers, or tell how after long-continued
        dangers we succeeded in wiping out the disgrace they incurred, and
        how many a prudent general retrieved their blunders. Nor need I
        recall the second chapter of our misfortunes and the exploits of
        Carus<a id="noteref_81" name="noteref_81" href=
        "#note_81"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">81</span></span></a> that
        followed, when after those failures he was appointed general. Among
        those who sat on the throne before your father's time and imposed on
        the Persians conditions of peace admired and welcomed by all, did not
        the Caesar<a id="noteref_82" name="noteref_82" href=
        "#note_82"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">82</span></span></a> incur a
        disgraceful defeat when he attacked them on his own account? It was
        not till the ruler of the whole world<a id="noteref_83" name=
        "noteref_83" href="#note_83"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">83</span></span></a> turned
        his attention to them, directing thither all the forces of the
        empire, occupying all the passes with his troops and levies of
        hoplites, both veterans and new recruits, and employing every sort of
        military equipments, that fear drove them to accept terms of peace.
        That peace they somehow contrived to disturb and break during your
        father's lifetime, but they escaped punishment at his hands because
        he died in the midst of preparations for a campaign. It was left for
        you later on to punish them for their audacity. I shall often have to
        speak of your campaigns against them, but this one thing I ask my
        hearers to observe. You became master of a third of the empire,<a id=
        "noteref_84" name="noteref_84" href="#note_84"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">84</span></span></a> that
        part in fact which seemed by no means strong enough to carry on a
        war, since it had neither arms nor troops in the field, nor any of
        those military resources which ought to flow in abundantly in
        preparation for so important a war. Then, too, your brothers, for
        whatever reason, did nothing to make the war easier for you. And yet
        there is no sycophant so shameless and so envious as not to admit
        that the harmony existing between you was mainly due to you. The war
        in itself presented peculiar difficulties, in my opinion, and the
        troops were disaffected owing to the change of government; they
        raised the cry that they missed their old leader and they wished to
        control your actions. Nay, more; a thousand strange and perplexing
        circumstances arose on every hand to render your hopes regarding the
        war more difficult to realise. The Armenians, our ancient allies,
        revolted, and no small part of them went over to the Persians and
        overran and raided the country on their borders. In this crisis there
        seemed to be but one hope of safety, that you should take charge of
        affairs and plan the campaign, but at the moment this was impossible,
        because you were in Paeonia<a id="noteref_85" name="noteref_85" href=
        "#note_85"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">85</span></span></a> making
        treaties with your brothers. Thither you went in person, and so
        managed that you gave them no opening for criticism. Indeed, I almost
        forgot to mention the very first of your achievements, the noblest of
        all, or at any rate equal to the noblest. For there is no greater
        proof of your prudence and magnanimity than the fact that, in
        planning for interests of such importance, you thought it no
        disadvantage if you should, of your own free will, concede the lion's
        share to your brothers. Imagine, for instance, a man dividing among
        his brothers their father's estate of a hundred talents, or, if you
        prefer, twice as much. Then suppose him to have been content with
        fifty minae less than the others, and to raise no objection, because
        he secured their goodwill in exchange for that trifling sum. You
        would think he deserved all praise and respect as one who had a soul
        above money, as far-sighted, in short as a man of honour. But here is
        one whose policy with regard to the empire of the world seems to have
        been so high minded, so prudent, that, without increasing the burdens
        of administration, he willingly gave up some of the imperial revenues
        in order to secure harmony and peace among all Roman citizens. What
        praise such a one deserves! And certainly one cannot, in this
        connection, quote the saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“Well done, but
        a bad bargain.”</span> Nothing, in my opinion, can be called a good
        bargain if it be not honourable as well. In general, if anyone wish
        to apply the test of expediency alone, he ought not to make money his
        criterion or reckon up his revenues from estates, like those old
        misers whom writers of comedy bring on to the stage, but he should
        take into account the vastness of the empire and the point of honour
        involved. If the Emperor had disputed about the boundaries and taken
        a hostile attitude, he might have obtained more than he did, but he
        would have governed only his allotted share. But he scorned and
        despised such trifles, and the result was that he really governed the
        whole world in partnership with his brothers, but had the care of his
        own portion only, and, while he kept his dignity unimpaired, he had
        less than his share of the toil and trouble that go with such a
        position.)</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(On that subject,
        however, I shall have a chance later to speak in more detail. This is
        perhaps the right moment to describe how you controlled the
        situation, encompassed as you were, after your father's death, by so
        many perils and difficulties of all sorts—confusion, an unavoidable
        war, numerous hostile raids, allies in revolt, lack of discipline in
        the garrisons, and all the other harassing conditions of the hour.
        You concluded in perfect harmony the negotiations with your brothers,
        and when the time had arrived that demanded your aid for the
        dangerous crisis of affairs, you made forced marches, and immediately
        after leaving Paeonia appeared in Syria. But to relate how you did
        this would tax my powers of description, and indeed for those who
        know the facts their own experience is enough. But who in the world
        could describe adequately how, at the prospect of your arrival,
        everything was changed and improved all at once, so that we were set
        free from the fears that hung over us and could entertain brighter
        hopes than ever for the future? Even before you were actually on the
        spot the mutiny among the garrisons ceased and order was restored.
        The Armenians who had gone over to the enemy at once changed sides
        again, for you ejected from the country and sent to Rome those who
        were responsible for the governor's<a id="noteref_90" name=

        and you secured for the exiles a safe return to their own country.
        You were so merciful to those who now came to Rome as exiles, and so
        kind in your dealings with those who returned from exile with the
        governor, that the former did, indeed, bewail their misfortune in
        having revolted, but still were better pleased with their present
        condition than with their previous usurpation; while the latter, who
        were formerly in exile, declared that the experience had been a
        lesson in prudence, but that now they were receiving a worthy reward
        for their loyalty. On the returned exiles you lavished such
        magnificent presents and rewards that they could not even resent the
        good fortune of their bitterest enemies, nor begrudge their being
        duly honoured. All these difficulties you quickly settled, and then
        by means of embassies you turned the marauding Arabs against our
        enemies. Then you began preparations for the war, about which I may
        as well say a few words.)</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(The previous
        period of peace had relaxed the labours of the troops, and lightened
        the burdens of those who had to perform public services. But the war
        called for money, provisions, and supplies on a vast scale, and even
        more it demanded endurance, energy, and military experience on the
        part of the troops. In the almost entire absence of all these, you
        personally provided and organised everything, drilled those who had
        reached the age for military service, got together a force of cavalry
        to match the enemy's, and issued orders for the infantry to persevere
        in their training. Nor did you confine yourself to speeches and
        giving orders, but yourself trained and drilled with the troops,
        showed them their duty by actual example, and straightway made them
        experts in the art of war. Then you discovered ways and means, not by
        increasing the tribute or the extraordinary contributions, as the
        Athenians did in their day, when they raised these to double or even
        more. You were content, I understand, with the original revenues,
        except in cases where, for a short time, and to meet an emergency, it
        was necessary that the people should find their services to the state
        more expensive. The troops under your leadership were abundantly
        supplied, yet not so as to cause the satiety that leads to insolence,
        nor, on the other hand, were they driven to insubordination from lack
        of necessaries. I shall say nothing about your great array of arms,
        horses, and river-boats, engines of war and the like. But when all
        was ready and the time had come to make appropriate use of all that I
        have mentioned, the Tigris was bridged by rafts at many points and
        forts were built to guard the river. Meanwhile the enemy never once
        ventured to defend their country from plunder, and every useful thing
        that they possessed was brought in to us. This was partly because
        they were afraid to offer battle, partly because those who were rash
        enough to do so were punished on the spot. This is a mere summary of
        your invasions of the enemy's country. Who, indeed, in a short speech
        could do justice to every event, or reckon up the enemy's disasters
        and our successes? But this at least I have space to tell. You often
        crossed the Tigris with your army and spent a long time in the
        enemy's country, but you always returned crowned with the laurels of
        victory. Then you visited the cities you had freed, and bestowed on
        them peace and plenty, all possible blessings and all at once. Thus
        at your hands they received what they had so long desired, the defeat
        of the barbarians and the erection of trophies of victory over the
        treachery and cowardice of the Parthians. Treachery they had
        displayed when they violated the treaties and broke the peace,
        cowardice when they lacked the courage to fight for their country and
        all that they held dear.)</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(But lest anyone
        should suppose that, while I delight in recalling exploits like
        these, I avoid mentioning occasions when luck gave the enemy the
        advantage—or rather it was the nature of the ground combined with
        opportunity that turned the scale—and that I do so because they
        brought us no honour or glory but only disgrace, I will try to give a
        brief account of those incidents also, not adapting my narrative with
        an eye to my own interests, but preferring the truth in every case.
        For when a man deliberately sins against the truth he cannot escape
        the reproach of flattery, and moreover he inflicts on the object of
        his panegyric the appearance of not deserving the praise that he
        receives on other accounts. This is a mistake of which I shall
        beware. Indeed my speech will make it clear that in no case has
        fiction been preferred to the truth. Now I am well aware that all
        would say that the battle we fought before Singara<a id="noteref_104"
        name="noteref_104" href="#note_104"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">104</span></span></a> was a
        most important victory for the barbarians. But I should answer and
        with justice that this battle inflicted equal loss on both armies,
        but proved also that your valour could accomplish more than their
        luck; and that although the legions under you were violent and
        reckless men, and were not accustomed, like the enemy, to the climate
        and the stifling heat. I will relate exactly what took place. It was
        still the height of summer, and the legions mustered long before
        noon. Since the enemy were awestruck by the discipline, accoutrements
        and calm bearing of our troops, while to us they seemed amazing in
        numbers, neither side began the battle; for they shrank from coming
        to close quarters with forces so well equipped, while we waited for
        them to begin, so that in all respects we might seem to be acting
        rather in self-defence, and not to be responsible for beginning
        hostilities after the peace. But at last the leader<a id=
        "noteref_105" name="noteref_105" href="#note_105"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">105</span></span></a> of the
        barbarian army, raised high on their shields, perceived the magnitude
        of our forces drawn up in line. What a change came over him! What
        exclamations he uttered! He cried out that he had been betrayed, that
        it was the fault of those who had persuaded him to go to war, and
        decided that the only thing to be done was to flee with all speed,
        and that one course alone would secure his safety, namely to cross,
        before we could reach it, the river, which is the ancient
        boundary-line between that country and ours. With this purpose he
        first gave the signal for a retreat in good order, then gradually
        increasing his pace he finally took to headlong flight, with only a
        small following of cavalry, and left his whole army to the leadership
        of his son and the friend in whom he had most confidence. When our
        men saw this they were enraged that the barbarians should escape all
        punishment for their audacious conduct, and clamoured to be led in
        pursuit, chafed at your order to halt, and ran after the enemy in
        full armour with their utmost energy and speed. For of your
        generalship they had had no experience so far, and they could not
        believe that you were a better judge than they of what was expedient.
        Moreover, under your father they had fought many battles and had
        always been victorious, a fact that tended to make them think
        themselves invincible. But they were most of all elated by the terror
        that the Parthians now shewed, when they thought how they had fought,
        not only against the enemy, but against the very nature of the
        ground, and if any greater obstacle met them from some fresh quarter,
        they felt that they would overcome it as well. Accordingly they ran
        at full speed for about one hundred stades, and only halted when they
        came up with the Parthians, who had fled for shelter into a fort that
        they had lately built to serve as a camp. It was, by this time,
        evening, and they engaged battle forthwith. Our men at once took the
        fort and slew its defenders. Once inside the fortifications they
        displayed great bravery for a long time, but they were by this time
        fainting with thirst, and when they found cisterns of water inside,
        they spoiled a glorious victory and gave the enemy a chance to
        retrieve their defeat. This then was the issue of that battle, which
        caused us the loss of only three or four of our men, whilst the
        Parthians lost the heir to the throne<a id="noteref_106" name=
        "noteref_106" href="#note_106"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">106</span></span></a> who had
        previously been taken prisoner, together with all his escort. While
        all this was going on, of the leader of the barbarians not even the
        ghost was to be seen, nor did he stay his flight till he had put the
        river behind him. You, on the other hand, did not take off your
        armour for a whole day and all the night, now sharing the struggles
        of those who were getting the upper hand, now giving prompt and
        efficient aid to those who were hard-pressed. And by your bravery and
        fortitude you so changed the face of the battle that at break of day
        the enemy were glad to beat a safe retreat to their own territory,
        and even the wounded, escorted by you, could retire from the battle.
        Thus did you relieve them all from the risks of flight. Now what fort
        was taken by the enemy? What city did they besiege? What military
        supplies did they capture that should give them something to boast
        about after the war?)</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(Is a man a
        skilful pilot because he can steer his ship in fair weather when the
        sea is absolutely calm? Would you call a charioteer an expert driver
        who on smooth and level ground has in harness horses that are gentle,
        quiet and swift, and under such conditions gives a display of his
        art? How much more skilful is the pilot who marks and perceives
        beforehand the coming storm and tries to avoid its path, and then, if
        for any reason he must face it, brings off his ship safe and sound,
        cargo and all? Just so, the skilful charioteer is he who can contend
        against the unevenness of the ground, and guide his horses and
        control them at the same time, if they grow restive. In short, it is
        not fair to judge of skill of any sort when it is aided by fortune,
        but one must examine it independently. Cleon was not a better general
        than Nicias because he was fortunate in the affair of Pylos, and the
        same may be said of all whose success is due to luck rather than to
        good judgment. But if I did not claim that your fortune was both
        better and better deserved than that of your opponents, or rather of
        all men, I should with reason be thought to do it an injustice, since
        it prevented the enemy from even perceiving their advantage. For, in
        my opinion, an impartial judge of my narrative ought to ascribe our
        reverse to the extreme and insupportable heat, and the fact that you
        inflicted loss on the enemy equal to ours he would regard as achieved
        by your valour, but that, though they were aware of their losses,
        they took no account of their success, he would regard as brought
        about by your good fortune.)</p>

        he himself kept imploring you to send money and men to his aid, as
        though he were terribly afraid on his own account of being
        overpowered by them. And for a while he kept protesting that he would
        do his duty, that for his part he had no pretensions to the throne,
        but would faithfully guard and protect it for you. Such were his
        assertions, but it was not long before his treachery came to light
        and he received his punishment, tempered though it was with mercy. On
        learning these facts you thought you ought not to waste your time in
        idleness to no purpose. The cities of Syria you stocked with engines
        of war, garrisons, food supplies, and equipment of other kinds,
        considering that, by these measures, you would, though absent,
        sufficiently protect the inhabitants, while you were planning to set
        out in person against the usurpers.)</p>

        ever since the last campaign had been watching for just such an
        opportunity, and had planned to conquer Syria, by a single invasion.
        So they mustered all forces, every age, sex, and condition, and
        marched against us, men and mere boys, old men and crowds of women
        and slaves, who followed not merely to assist in the war, but in vast
        numbers beyond what was needed. For it was their intention to reduce
        the cities, and once masters of the country, to bring in colonists in

        dykes, and then the river Mygdonius flowed in and flooded the ground
        about the walls, as they say the Nile floods Egypt. The siege-engines
        were brought up against the ramparts on boats, and their plan was
        that one force should sail to attack the walls while the other kept
        shooting on the city's defenders from the mounds. But the garrison
        made a stout defence of the city from the walls. The whole place was
        filled with corpses, wreckage, armour, and missiles, of which some
        were just sinking, while others, after sinking from the violence of
        the first shock, floated on the waters. A vast number of barbarian
        shields and also ship's benches, as a result of the collisions of the
        siege-engines on the ships, drifted on the surface. The mass of
        floating weapons almost covered the whole surface between the wall
        and the mounds. The lake was turned to gore, and all about the walls
        echoed the groans of the barbarians, slaying not, but being

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(Who could find
        suitable words to describe all that was done there? They hurled fire
        down on to the shields, and many of the hoplites fell half-burned,
        while others who fled from the flames could not escape the danger
        from the missiles. But some while still swimming were wounded in the
        back and sank to the bottom, while others who jumped from the
        siege-engines were hit before they touched the water, and so found
        not safety indeed but an easier death. As for those who knew not how
        to swim, and perished more obscurely than those just mentioned, who
        would attempt to name or number them? Time would fail me did I desire
        to recount all this in detail. It is enough that you should hear the
        sum of the matter. On that day the sun beheld a battle the like of
        which no man had ever known before. These events exposed the historic
        boastings of the Medes as only empty conceit. Till then men had
        hardly believed that Xerxes could have had so huge an armament,
        seeing that for all its size its fate was so shameful and
        ignominious; but these events made the fact clearer to us than things
        long familiar and obvious. Xerxes tried to sail and to march by
        fighting against the laws of nature, and, as he thought, overcame the
        nature of the sea and of the dry land, but he proved to be no match
        for the wisdom and endurance of a Greek whose soldiers had not been
        bred in the school of luxury, nor learned to be slaves, but knew how
        to obey and to use their energies like free-born men. That man,<a id=

        however, though he had no such vast armament as Xerxes, was even more
        insensate, and outdid the Aloadae in his infatuation, as if almost he
        had conceived the idea of overwhelming the city with the
        mountain<a id="noteref_124" name="noteref_124" href=
        "#note_124"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        was hard by. Then he turned the currents of rivers against its walls
        and undermined them, but even when the city had lost its walls he
        could not succeed in taking it, so that he had not even that triumph
        to boast of, as Xerxes had when he set fire to Athens. So, after
        spending four months, he retreated with an army that had lost many
        thousands, and he who had always seemed to be irresistible was glad
        to keep the peace, and to use as a bulwark for his own safety the
        fact that you had no time to spare and that our own affairs were in
        confusion.)</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(Such were the
        trophies and victories that you left behind you in Asia, and you led
        your troops to Europe in perfect condition, determined to fill the
        whole world with the monuments of your victories. Even if I had
        nothing more wonderful to relate about you, what I have said is
        enough to demonstrate that in good sense and energy you surpass all
        those in the past whose fortune was the same as yours. Indeed to have
        repulsed the whole strength of Persia and remain unscathed, not to
        have lost so much as a soldier from the ranks, much less a town or
        fort, and finally to have brought the siege to so brilliant and
        unprecedented a conclusion,—what achievement I ask in the past could
        one compare with this? The Carthaginians were famous for their daring
        in the face of danger, but they ended in disaster. The siege of
        Plataea shed lustre on its citizens, but all that their valour could
        do for those unhappy men was to make their misfortunes more widely
        known. What need to quote Messene or Pylos, since there the defeated
        did not make a brave defence nor was a vigorous assault necessary to
        subdue them? As for the Syracusans, they had their famous man of
        science<a id="noteref_126" name="noteref_126" href=

        what did he avail them in the end? Did they not fall more
        ignominiously than the rest, and were only spared to be a glorious
        monument of their conqueror's clemency? But if I wished to reckon up
        all the states that could not withstand armaments inferior to their
        own, how many volumes do you think would suffice? Rome, however, I
        ought perhaps to mention, because long ago she had just such a

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(It is with this
        siege that the recent one may well be compared, at least in the issue
        of its fortunes; for the actual occurrences could not be paralleled
        in all history. For who ever heard of surrounding a city with water,
        and from without throwing hills about it like nets, then hurling at
        it, like a siege-engine, a river that flowed in a steady stream and
        broke against its walls, or of fighting like that which took place in
        the water and about the wall where it had fallen in? For my purpose,
        this is, as I said, evidence enough. But what remains to tell is far
        more awe-inspiring. And perhaps, since I have undertaken to record,
        as far as possible, all that you accomplished, it is not fair to
        break off my narrative at the point where you were at the very height
        of your activity. For even while you were occupied by the interests I
        have just described, you arranged your affairs in Europe, despatching
        embassies, spending money, and sending out the legions that were
        garrisoning Paeonia against the Scythians, all of which was with the

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(No sooner had you
        set out for the seat of war, than this very man, who had all along
        protested that he would loyally continue to guard your interests,
        though you had reinforced him with money, troops, and everything of
        the sort, was driven to folly and madness by I know not what evil
        spirit, and came to terms with the most execrable of mankind, the
        common enemy of all who care for peace and cherish harmony above all
        things, and more particularly your enemy for personal reasons. But
        you were undismayed by the magnitude of his preparations, nor would

        purpose. One<a id="noteref_140" name="noteref_140" href=

        infamous crimes besides, and deeds of lawless violence, and you
        summoned the former to trial and judgment before the legions, the
        latter you decided to leave to the arbitrament of war. Then he met
        you face to face, that honourable and prudent old man, who used to
        change his opinions more easily than any child, and, though he had
        begged for them, forgot all your favours as soon as the need had
        passed. He arrived with his phalanxes of hoplites and squadrons of
        cavalry, intending to compel, if he could not persuade you, to take
        no action and return the way you came. When, then, you saw this man,
        who had protested that he would continue to be your ally and general,
        playing an enemy's part and claiming an equal share of your empire,
        you were not at all dismayed, though his troops outnumbered yours.
        For you had not brought your whole force with you since you decided
        that to fight it out with such odds against you might be courageous
        but was in every way hazardous, even if you won the battle, because
        of that other savage usurper<a id="noteref_142" name="noteref_142"

        you should be in difficulties. You therefore made a wise resolve in
        preferring to achieve success single-handed, and you mounted the
        platform with him who for the moment was your colleague in empire. He
        was escorted by a whole host of hoplites with glittering
        weapons,<a id="noteref_144" name="noteref_144" href=

        presenting drawn swords and spears, a sight to make a coward shake
        with fear, though it inspired and supported one so brave and gallant
        as yourself. Now when first you began to speak, silence fell on the
        whole army and every man strained his ears to hear. Many shed tears
        and raised their hands to heaven, though even this they did in
        silence, so as to be unobserved. Some again showed their affection in
        their faces, but all showed it by their intense eagerness to hear
        your words. When your speech reached its climax, they were carried
        away by enthusiasm and burst into applause, then eager to miss no
        word they became quiet again. Finally, won by your arguments, they
        hailed you as their only Emperor, demanded that you alone should rule
        the whole empire, and bade you lead them against your adversary,
        promising to follow you and begging you to take back the imperial
        insignia. You, however, thought it beneath you to stretch out your
        hand for them or to take them by force. Then against his will and
        with reluctance, but yielding at last to what is called Thessalian
        persuasion,<a id="noteref_145" name="noteref_145" href=

        off the purple robe and offered it to you. What a heroic figure yours
        was then, when, in a single day, you became master of all those
        races, those legions, all that wealth, when you stripped of his power
        and took prisoner one who, if not in fact yet in intention, had shown
        that he was your enemy!)</p>

        was reserved for you to combine them once more in your person, in
        this surely following the example of Odysseus and Nestor and the
        Roman generals who sacked Carthage; for these men were always even
        more formidable to wrong-doers whom they attacked from the platform
        than to the enemy in the field of battle. Indeed I pay all the homage
        due to the forcible eloquence of Demosthenes and his imitators, but
        when I consider the conditions of your harangue I can never admit
        that there is any comparison between your theatre and theirs. For
        they never had to address an audience of hoplites nor had they such
        great interests at stake, but only money, or honour, or reputation,
        or friends whom they had undertaken to assist, yet when the citizens
        clamoured in dissent, they often, I believe, left the platform pale
        and trembling, like generals who prove to be cowards when they have
        to face the enemy in battle-line. Indeed from all history it would be
        impossible to cite an achievement as great as yours when you acquired
        control of all those races by judicial pleading alone; and moreover
        you had to make out your case against a man not by any means to be
        despised, as many people think, but one who had won distinction in
        many campaigns, who was full of years, who had the reputation of
        experience gained in a long career, and had for a considerable period
        been in command of the legions there present. What overwhelming
        eloquence that must have been! How truly did <span class=

        the power to <span class="tei tei-q">“leave a sting”</span> in the
        souls of that motley crowd of men, and to win you a victory that in
        importance rivals any that were ever achieved by force of arms, only
        that yours was stainless and unalloyed, and was more like the act of
        a priest going to the temple of his god than of an emperor going to
        war. It is true indeed that the Persians have a similar instance to
        quote, but it falls far short of what you did, I mean that on their
        father's death the sons of Darius quarrelled about the succession to
        the throne and appealed to justice rather than to arms to arbitrate
        their case. But between you and your brothers there never arose any
        dispute, either in word or deed, nay not one, for it was in fact more
        agreeable to you to share the responsibility with them than to be the
        sole ruler of the world. But your quarrel was with one who, though
        his actions had not so far been impious or criminal, was shown to
        have a treasonable purpose, and you brought proofs to make that
        treason manifest.)</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(I need not
        mention all the usurper's offences against the community and against
        individuals. He assassinated his own master. For he had actually been
        the slave of the murdered emperor's ancestors, a miserable remnant
        saved from the spoils of Germany. And then he aimed at ruling over
        us, he who had not even the right to call himself free, had you not
        granted him the privilege. Those in command of the legions he
        imprisoned and put to death, while to the common soldiers he behaved
        with such abject servility and deference that he ruined their
        discipline. Then he enacted those fine laws of his, a property tax of
        fifty per cent., and threatened the disobedient with death, while any
        slave who pleased might inform against his master. Then he compelled
        those who did not want it to purchase the imperial property. But time
        would fail me were I to tell of all his crimes and of the vast
        proportions that his tyranny had assumed. As for the armament which
        he had collected to use against the barbarians but actually employed
        against us, who could give you an adequate report of its strength?

        seemed invincible even to our ancestors, and who had so often like a
        winter torrent that sweeps all before it,<a id="noteref_166" name=

        down on the Italians and Illyrians, and, following up their repeated
        victories on the field of battle, had even invaded Asia, and then
        became our subjects because they had no choice. They had been
        enrolled in the ranks of our armies and furnished levies that won a
        brilliant reputation, being enlisted by your ancestors, and, later,
        by your father. Then, since they enjoyed the blessings of
        long-continued peace, and their country increased in wealth and
        population, they furnished your brothers with considerable levies,
        and finally, by compulsion, not choice, they all in a body took part
        in the usurper's campaign. The most enthusiastic of his followers
        were, in virtue of their ties of kinship, the Franks and Saxons, the
        most warlike of the tribes who live beyond the Rhine and on the
        shores of the western sea. And since every city and every fortified
        place on the banks of the Rhine was shorn of its garrison, that whole
        region was left with no defence against the barbarians, and all that
        splendidly organised army was despatched against us. Every town in
        Galatia<a id="noteref_167" name="noteref_167" href=
        "#note_167"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">167</span></span></a> was
        like a camp preparing for war. Nothing was to be seen but weapons of
        war and forces of cavalry, infantry, archers, and javelin men. When
        these allies of the usurper began to pour into Italy from all
        quarters and there joined the troops who had been enrolled long
        before, there was no one so bold as not to feel terror and dismay at
        the tempest that threatened.<a id="noteref_168" name="noteref_168"
        href="#note_168"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">168</span></span></a> It
        seemed to all as though a thunderbolt had fallen from the Alps, a
        bolt that no action could avert, no words describe. It struck terror
        into the Illyrians, the Paeonians, the Thracians, the Scythians; the
        dwellers in Asia believed it was directed entirely against
        themselves, and even the Persians began to get ready to oppose it in
        their country's defence. But the usurper thought his task was easy,
        and that he would have little difficulty in baffling your wisdom and
        energy, and already fixed his covetous gaze on the wealth of India
        and the magnificence of Persia. To such an excess of folly and
        rashness had he come, and after a success wholly insignificant, I
        mean the affair of the scouts whom, while they were unprotected by
        the main army, he ambushed and cut in pieces. So true it is that when
        fools meet with undeserved success<a id="noteref_169" name=
        "noteref_169" href="#note_169"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">169</span></span></a> they
        often find it is but the prelude to greater misfortunes. And so,
        elated by this stroke of luck, he left the fortified posts that
        protected the Italian frontier, and marched towards the Norici and
        the Paeonians, taking no precautions, because he thought that speed
        would serve him better than force of arms or courage.)</p>

        sight, the cavalry of both armies were drawn up on the wings, while
        the infantry formed the centre. Then your Majesty kept the river on
        your right, and, outflanking the enemy with your left, you at once
        turned and broke his phalanx, which indeed had from the first the
        wrong formation, since it had been drawn up by one who knew nothing
        of war or strategy. Then he who so far had thought he was the pursuer
        did not even join battle, but took to headlong flight, dismayed by
        the clash of weapons; he could not even listen without trembling when
        the legions shouted their battle-song. His ranks had been thrown into
        disorder, but the soldiers formed into companies and renewed the
        battle. For they disdained to be seen in flight, and to give an
        example in their own persons of what had hitherto been inconceivable
        to all men, I mean a Celtic or Galatian<a id="noteref_173" name=

        turning his back to the enemy. The barbarians too, who, if defeated,
        could not hope to make good their retreat, were resolved either to
        conquer, or not to perish till they had severely punished their
        opponents. Just see the extraordinary daring of the usurper's troops
        in the face of dangers and their great eagerness to come to close
        quarters!)</p>

        other hand, had so far carried all before them and were anxious to
        retain the good opinion of their comrades and of the Emperor, and
        were moreover stimulated by their successes in the past and by the
        almost incredible brilliance of their exploits in this very
        engagement, and, ambitious as they were to end the day as gloriously
        as they had begun it, cheerfully encountered toil and danger. So they
        charged again as though the battle had only just begun, and gave a
        wonderful display of daring and heroism. For some hurled themselves
        full on the enemy's swords, or seized the enemy's shields, others,
        when their horses were wounded and the riders thrown, at once
        transformed themselves into hoplites. The usurper's army meanwhile
        did the same and pressed our infantry hard. Neither side gained the
        advantage, till the cuirassiers by their archery, aided by the
        remaining force of cavalry, who spurred on their horses to the
        charge, had begun to inflict great loss on the enemy, and by main
        force to drive the whole army before them. Some directed their flight
        to the plain, and of these a few were saved just in time by the
        approach of night. The rest were flung into the river, crowded
        together like a herd of oxen or brute beasts. Thus did the usurper's
        army reap the fruits of his cowardice, while their valour availed him
        nothing.)</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(The trophy that
        you set up for that victory was far more brilliant than your

        tyranny that you suppressed was flourishing and had reached its
        height, partly through the crimes that had been committed, but still
        more because so many of the youth were on that side, and you took the
        field against it with legions that had been trained by yourself. What
        emperor can one cite in the past who first planned and then
        reproduced so admirable a type of cavalry, and such accoutrements?
        First you trained yourself to wear them, and then you taught others
        how to use such weapons so that none could withstand them. This is a
        subject on which many have ventured to speak, but they have failed to
        do it justice, so much so that those who heard their description, and
        later had the good fortune to see for themselves, decided that their
        eyes must accept what their ears had refused to credit. Your cavalry
        was almost unlimited in numbers and they all sat their horses like
        statues, while their limbs were fitted with armour that followed
        closely the outline of the human form. It covers the arms from wrist
        to elbow and thence to the shoulder, while a coat of mail protects
        the shoulders, back and breast. The head and face are covered by a
        metal mask which makes its wearer look like a glittering statue, for
        not even the thighs and legs and the very ends of the feet lack this
        armour. It is attached to the cuirass by fine chain-armour like a
        web, so that no part of the body is visible and uncovered, for this
        woven covering protects the hands as well, and is so flexible that
        the wearers can bend even their fingers.<a id="noteref_177" name=

        this I desire to represent in words as vividly as I can, but it is
        beyond my powers, and I can only ask those who wish to know more
        about this armour to see it with their own eyes, and not merely to
        listen to my description.)</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(Now that I have
        told the story of this first campaign, which was fought at the end of
        the autumn, shall I here break off my narrative? Or is it altogether
        unfair to withhold the end and issue of your achievements from those
        who are eager to hear? Winter overtook us and gave the usurper a
        chance to escape punishment. Then followed a splendid proclamation
        worthy of your imperial generosity. An amnesty was granted to those
        who had taken sides with the usurper, except when they had shared the
        guilt of those infamous murders. Thus they who had never hoped even
        to see again anything that they held dear, recovered their houses,
        money, and native land. Then you welcomed the fleet which arrived
        from Italy bringing thence many citizens who, no doubt, had fled from
        the usurper's savage cruelty. Then when the occasion demanded that
        you should take the field, you again menaced the usurper. He however
        took cover in the fastnesses of Italy and hid his army away there in
        the mountains, wild-beast fashion, and never even dared to carry on
        the war beneath the open heavens. But he betook himself to the
        neighbouring town<a id="noteref_180" name="noteref_180" href=
        "#note_180"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">180</span></span></a> which
        is devoted to pleasure and high living, and spent his time in public
        shows and sensual pleasures, believing that the impassable mountains
        alone would suffice for his safety. Moreover, intemperate as he was
        by nature, he thought it clear gain to be able to indulge his
        appetites at so dangerous a crisis, and he evidently placed too much
        confidence in the safety of his position, because the town is cut off
        from that part of Italy by a natural rampart of mountains, except the
        half that is bounded by a shoaling sea, which resembles the marshes
        of Egypt and makes that part of the country inaccessible even to an
        invading fleet. It seems however as though nature herself will not
        devise any safeguard for the sensual and cowardly against the
        temperate and brave, for when prudence and courage advance hand in
        hand she makes everything give way before them. Long since she
        revealed to us those arts through which we have attained an abundance
        of what was once thought to be unattainable, and in the field of
        individual effort we see that what seemed impossible for many working
        together to achieve can be accomplished by a prudent man. And since
        by your own actions you demonstrated this fact it is only fair, O my
        Emperor, that you should accept my words to that effect.)</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(For you conducted
        the campaign under the open skies, and that though there was a city
        of some importance near at hand, and moreover you encouraged your men
        to work hard and to take risks, not merely by giving orders, but by
        your own personal example. You discovered a path hitherto unknown to
        all, and you sent forward a strong detachment of hoplites chosen from
        your whole army; then when you had ascertained that they had come up
        with the enemy, you led forward your army in person, surrounded them,
        and defeated his whole force. This happened before dawn, and before
        noon the news was brought to the usurper. He was attending a
        horse-race at a festival, and was expecting nothing of what took
        place. How his attitude changed, what was his decision about the
        crisis, how he abandoned the town and in fact all Italy, and fled,
        thus beginning to expiate his murders and all his earlier crimes, it
        is not for this speech to relate. Yet though the respite he gained
        was so brief, he proceeded to act no less wickedly than in the past.
        So true is it that by the sufferings of the body alone it is
        impossible for the wicked to cleanse their souls of evil. For when he
        reached Galatia,<a id="noteref_183" name="noteref_183" href=

        ruler who was so righteous and law-abiding, so far surpassed his own
        former cruelty that he now bethought himself of all the ruthless and
        brutal modes of punishment that he had then overlooked, and derived
        the most exquisite pleasure from the spectacle of the sufferings of
        the wretched citizens. He would bind them alive to chariots and,
        letting the teams gallop, would order the drivers to drag them along
        while he stood by and gazed at their sufferings. In fact he spent his
        whole time in amusements of this sort, until, like an Olympic victor,
        you threw him in the third encounter<a id="noteref_184" name=
        "noteref_184" href="#note_184"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">184</span></span></a> and
        forced him to pay a fitting penalty for his infamous career, namely
        to thrust into his own breast that very sword which he had stained
        with the slaughter of so many citizens.<a id="noteref_185" name=

        in my opinion, was there a punishment more suitable or more just than
        this, nor one that gave greater satisfaction to the whole human race,
        which was now really liberated from such cruelty and harshness, and
        at once began to exult in the good government that we enjoy to this
        day. Long may we continue to enjoy it, O all-merciful
        Providence!)</p>

        recite every single one of your achievements, but you will with
        reason pardon me, most mighty Emperor, if I fall short of that
        ambition and omit to mention the naval armament against Carthage
        which was equipped in Egypt and set sail from Italy to attack her,
        and also your conquest of the Pyrenees, against which you sent an
        army by sea, and your successes against the barbarians, which of late
        have been so frequent, and all such successes in the past as have not
        become a matter of common knowledge. For example, I often hear that
        even Antioch now calls herself by your name. Her existence she does
        indeed owe to her founder,<a id="noteref_189" name="noteref_189"

        present wealth and increase in every sort of abundance she owes to
        you, since you provided her with harbours that offer good anchorage
        for those who put in there. For till then it was considered a
        dangerous risk even to sail past Antioch; so full were all the waters
        of that coast, up to the very shores, of rocks and sunken reefs. I
        need not stop to mention the porticoes, fountains, and other things
        of the kind that you caused to be bestowed on Antioch by her
        governors. As to your benefactions to the city of your

        built round it a wall that was then only begun, and all buildings

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(The time has now
        come when it is proper to consider whether your career, so far as I
        have described it, is at every point in harmony with virtue and the
        promptings of a noble disposition. For to this, as I said at the
        beginning of my speech, I think it right to pay special attention.
        Let me therefore mention once more what I said some time ago, that to
        your father you were dutiful and affectionate, and that you
        constantly maintained friendly relations with your brothers, for your
        father you were ever willing to obey, and as the colleague of your
        brothers in the empire you always displayed moderation. And if anyone
        thinks this a trifling proof of merit, let him consider the case of
        Alexander the son of Philip, and Cyrus the son of Cambyses, and then
        let him applaud your conduct. For Alexander, while still a mere boy,
        showed clearly that he would no longer brook his father's control,
        while Cyrus dethroned his grandfather. Yet no one is so foolish as to
        suppose that, since you displayed such modesty and self-control
        towards your father and brothers, you were not fully equal to
        Alexander and Cyrus in greatness of soul and ambition for glory. For
        when fortune offered you the opportunity to claim as your right the
        empire of the world, you were the first to make the essay, though
        there were many who advised otherwise and tried to persuade you to
        the contrary course. Accordingly, when you had carried through the
        war that you had in hand, and that with the utmost ease and so as to
        ensure safety for the future, you resolved to liberate that part of
        the empire which had been occupied by the enemy, and the reason that
        you assigned for going to war was most just and such as had never
        before arisen, namely your detestation of those infamous men. Civil
        war one could not call it, for its leader was a barbarian who had
        proclaimed himself emperor and elected himself general. I dislike to
        speak too often of his evil deeds and the crimes that he committed
        against your house. But could anything be more heroic than your line
        of action? For should you fail in your undertaking the risk involved
        was obvious. But you faced it, and you were not bidding for gain, nay
        nor for undying renown, for whose sake brave men so often dare even
        to die, selling their lives for glory as though it were gold, nor was
        it from desire of wider or more brilliant empire, for not even in
        your youth were you ambitious of that, but it was because you were in
        love with the abstract beauty of such an achievement, and thought it
        your duty to endure anything rather than see a barbarian ruling over
        Roman citizens, making himself master of the laws and constitution
        and offering public prayers for the common weal, guilty as he was of
        so many impious crimes and murders. Who could fail to be dazzled by
        the splendour of your armament and the vast scale of your
        expenditure? And yet I am told that Xerxes, when he mustered all Asia
        against the Greeks, spent no less than ten years in preparing for
        that war. Then he set out with twelve hundred triremes, from the very
        spot, as I understand, where you gathered your fleet together, having
        built it in rather less than ten months, and yet you had more ships
        than Xerxes. But neither his fortune nor his achievements can
        properly be compared with yours.)</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(I fear that it is
        beyond my powers to describe the magnificence of your outlay for
        other purposes, nor will I risk being tedious by staying now to count
        up the sums you bestowed on cities that had long been destitute. For
        whereas, in the time of your predecessors, they lacked the
        necessaries of life, they have all become rich through you, and the
        general prosperity of each city increases the welfare of every
        private household in it. But it is proper that I should mention your
        gifts to private persons, and give you the title of a generous and
        open-handed Emperor; for since there were many who long ago had lost
        their property, because, in some cases justly, in others unjustly,
        their ancestral estates had suffered loss, you had no sooner come
        into power, than like a just judge you set right in the latter cases
        the errors committed by men in the past, and restored them to the
        control of their property, while in the former cases you were a
        kindly arbiter, and granted that they should recover what they had
        lost, thinking that to have suffered so long was punishment enough.
        Then you lavished large sums from your privy purse, and increased the
        reputation for wealth of many who even in the past had prided
        themselves on their large incomes. But why should I remind you of all
        this and seem to waste time over trifles? Especially as it must be
        obvious to all that no king except Alexander the son of Philip was
        ever known to bestow such splendid presents on his friends. Indeed
        some kings have thought that the wealth of their friends gave more
        grounds for suspicion and alarm than did the resources of their
        enemies, while others were jealous of the aristocrats among their
        subjects, and therefore persecuted the well-born in every possible
        way, or even exterminated their houses, and thus were responsible for
        the public disasters of their cities and, in private life, for the
        most infamous crimes. There were some who went so far as to envy mere
        physical advantages, such as health or good looks, or good condition.
        And as for a virtuous character among their subjects, they could not
        bear even to hear of it, but counted it a crime like murder or theft
        or treason to appear to lay claim to virtue. But perhaps someone will
        say, and with truth, that these were the actions and practices not of
        genuine kings but of base and contemptible tyrants. Nay, but that
        other malady which has been known to attack not only those who were
        irrational, but some even who were just and mild, I mean the tendency
        to quarrel with friends who were too prosperous and to wish to humble
        them and deprive them of their rightful possessions, who I ask has
        ever dared so much as to mention such conduct in your case? Yet such,
        they say, was the treatment that Cyrus the Persian, the king's
        son-in-law, received from his kinsman,<a id="noteref_196" name=
        "noteref_196" href="#note_196"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">196</span></span></a> who
        could not brook the honour in which Cyrus was held by the common
        people, and Agesilaus also is well known to have resented the honours
        paid to Lysander by the Ionians.)</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(All these, then,
        you have surpassed in merit, for you have made their wealth more
        secure for the rich than a father would for his own children, and you
        take thought that your subjects shall be well-born, as though you
        were the founder and law-giver of every single city. Those to whom
        fortune has been generous you still further enrich, and in many cases
        men owe all their wealth to your generosity, so that in amount your
        gifts clearly surpass those of other princes, while, in security of
        ownership of what has once been given, you cast into the shade any
        favours bestowed by democracies.<a id="noteref_198" name=

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">198</span></span></a> And
        this is, I think, very natural. For when men are conscious that they
        lack certain advantages, they envy those who do possess them, but
        when a man is more brilliantly endowed by fortune than any of his
        fellows, and by his own initiative has won even higher dignities than
        fate had assigned him, he lacks nothing, and there is none whom he
        need envy. And since you realise that in your case this is especially
        true, you rejoice at the good fortune of others and take pleasure in
        the successes of your subjects. You have already bestowed on them
        certain honours, and other honours you are on the point of bestowing,
        and you are making plans for the benefit of yet other persons. Nor
        are you content to award to your friends the government of a single
        city or nation, or even of many such, with the honours attaching
        thereto. But unless you chose a colleague<a id="noteref_199" name=
        "noteref_199" href="#note_199"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">199</span></span></a> to
        share that empire on whose behalf you had spared no pains to
        exterminate the brood of usurpers, you thought that no act of yours
        could be worthy of your former achievements. That you reached this
        decision not so much because it was necessary as because you take
        pleasure in giving all that you have to give, is, I suppose, well
        known to all. For you chose no colleague to aid you in your contests
        with the usurpers, but you thought it right that one who had not
        shared in the toil should share in the honour and glory, and that
        only when all danger seemed to be over. And it is well known that
        from that honour you subtract not even a trifling part, though you do
        not demand that he should share the danger even in some small degree,
        except indeed when it was necessary for a short time that he should
        accompany you on your campaign. Does my account of this call for any
        further witnesses or proofs? Surely it is obvious that he who tells
        the tale would not be the one to introduce a fictitious account. But
        on this part of my subject I must not spend any more time.)</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(A few words about
        your temperance, your wisdom, and the affection that you inspired in
        your subjects, will not, I think, be out of place. For who is there
        among them all who does not know that from boyhood you cultivated the
        virtue of temperance as no one had ever done before you? That in your
        youth you possessed that virtue your father is a trustworthy witness,
        for he entrusted to you alone the management of affairs of state and
        all that related to your brothers, although you were not even the
        eldest of his sons. And that you still display it, now that you are a
        man, we are all well aware, since you ever behave towards the people
        and the magistrates like a citizen who obeys the laws, not like a
        king who is above the laws. For who ever saw you made arrogant by
        prosperity? Who ever saw you uplifted by those successes, so numerous
        and so splendid, and so quickly achieved? They say that Alexander,
        Philip's son, when he had broken the power of Persia, not only
        adopted a more ostentatious mode of life and an insolence of manner
        obnoxious to all, but went so far as to despise the father that begat
        him, and indeed the whole human race. For he claimed to be regarded
        as the son of Ammon instead of the son of Philip, and when some of
        those who had taken part in his campaigns could not learn to flatter
        him or to be servile, he punished them more harshly than the
        prisoners of war. But the honour that you paid to your father need I
        speak of in this place? Not only did you revere him in private life,
        but constantly, where men were gathered together in public, you sang
        his praises as though he were a beneficent hero-god. And as for your
        friends, you grant them that honour not merely in name, but by your
        actions you make their title sure. Can any one of them, I ask, lay to
        your charge the loss of any right, or any penalty or injury suffered,
        or any overbearing act either serious or trifling? Nay there is not
        one who could bring any such accusation. For your friends who were
        far advanced in years remained in office till the appointed end of
        their lives, and only laid down with life itself their control of
        public business, and then they handed on their possessions to their
        children or friends or some member of their family. Others again,
        when their strength failed for work or military service, received an
        honourable discharge, and are now spending their last days in
        prosperity; yet others have departed this life, and the people call
        them blessed. In short there is no man who having once been held
        worthy of the honour of your friendship, ever suffered any punishment
        great or small, even though later he proved to be vicious. For them
        all that he had to do was to depart and give no further trouble.)</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(Your wisdom it is
        by no means easy to praise as it deserves, but I must say a few words
        about it. Your actions, however, are more convincing, I think, than
        my words. For it is not likely that this great and mighty empire
        would have attained such dimensions or achieved such splendid
        results, had it not been directed and governed by an intelligence to
        match. Indeed, when it is entrusted to luck alone, unaided by wisdom,
        we may be thankful if it last for any length of time. It is easy by
        depending on luck to flourish for a brief space, but without the aid
        of wisdom it is very hard, or rather I might say impossible, to
        preserve the blessings that have been bestowed. And, in short, if we
        need cite a convincing proof of this, we do not lack many notable
        instances. For by wise counsel we mean the ability to discover most
        successfully the measures that will be good and expedient when put
        into practice. It is therefore proper to consider in every case
        whether this wise counsel may not be counted as one of the things you
        have achieved. Certainly when there was need of harmony you gladly
        gave way, and when it was your duty to aid the community as a whole
        you declared for war with the utmost readiness. And when you had
        defeated the forces of Persia without losing a single hoplite, you
        made two separate campaigns against the usurpers, and after
        overcoming one of them<a id="noteref_208" name="noteref_208" href=
        "#note_208"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">208</span></span></a> by your
        public harangue, you added to your army his forces, which were fresh
        and had suffered no losses, and finally, by intelligence rather than
        by brute force, you completely subdued the other usurper who had
        inflicted so many sufferings on the community. I now desire to speak
        more clearly on this subject and to demonstrate to all what it was
        that you chiefly relied on and that secured you from failure in every
        one of those great enterprises to which you devoted yourself. It is
        your conviction that the affection of his subjects is the surest
        defence of an emperor. Now it is the height of absurdity to try to
        win that affection by giving orders, and levying it as though it were
        a tax or tribute. The only alternative is the policy that you have
        yourself pursued, I mean of doing good to all men and imitating the
        divine nature on earth. To show mercy even in anger, to take away
        their harshness from acts of vengeance, to display kindness and
        toleration to your fallen enemies, this was your practice, this you
        always commended and enjoined on others to imitate, and thus, even
        while the usurper still controlled Italy, you transferred Rome to
        Paeonia by means of the Senate and inspired the cities with zeal for
        undertaking public services.)</p>

        maintain that your conduct was not only humane and just, but prudent
        in a still higher degree. He who thinks otherwise falls short of a
        true understanding of both the circumstances and your policy. For
        that those who had not been proved guilty should be protected was of
        course just, and you thought you ought by no means to make friendship

          Oration is a panegyric of the Emperor Constantius, written while
          Julian, after his elevation to the rank of Caesar, was campaigning
          in Gaul.<a id="noteref_216" name="noteref_216" href=

          closely resembles and often echoes the First, and was probably
          never delivered. In his detailed and forced analogies of the
          achievements of Constantius with those of the Homeric heroes,
          always to the advantage of the former, Julian follows a sophistic
          practice that he himself condemns,<a id="noteref_217" name=

          though he more than once contrasts himself with the <span class=

          observe all their rules, even in his historical descriptions of the
          Emperor's campaigns. The long Platonic digression on Virtue and the
          ideal ruler is a regular feature of a panegyric of this type,
          though Julian neglects to make the direct application to
          Constantius. In the First Oration he quoted Homer only once, but
          while the Second contains the usual comparisons with the Persian
          monarchs and Alexander, its main object is to prove, by direct
          references to the Iliad, that Constantius surpassed Nestor in
          strategy, Odysseus in eloquence, and in courage Hector, Sarpedon
          and Achilles.</p>

          excessively rash and violent. But perhaps the son of Thetis is not
          free from this criticism either, that he spent in song and music
          the hours that called for deeds, though at such a time he might
          have retained his arms and not laid them aside, but later, at his
          leisure, he could have sung the praises of the king and chanted his

          makes him curse the cause of their quarrel, and recount the
          disasters due to his own wrath, and we see the king blaming Zeus

          using those heroes whom he sets before us, like types in a tragedy,
          and the moral is that kings ought never to behave insolently, nor
          use their power without reserve, nor be carried away by their anger
          like a spirited horse that runs away for lack of the bit and the
          driver; and then again he is warning generals not to resent the
          insolence of kings but to endure their censure with self-control

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(When I reflect
          on this, my beloved Emperor, and behold you displaying in all that
          you do the result of your study of Homer, and see you so eager to
          benefit every citizen in the community in every way, and devising
          for me individually such honours and privileges one after another,
          then I think that you desire to be nobler than the king of the
          Greeks, to such a degree, that, whereas he insulted his bravest
          men, you, I believe, grant forgiveness to many even of the
          undeserving, since you approve the maxim of Pittacus which set
          mercy before vengeance. And so I should be ashamed not to appear
          more reasonable than the son of Peleus, or to fail to praise, as
          far as in me lies, what appertains to you, I do not mean gold, or a
          robe of purple, nay by Zeus, nor raiment embroidered all over, the
          work of Sidonian women,<a id="noteref_224" name="noteref_224" href=

          the gleam and glitter of gold-mounted chariots, nor the precious
          stone of India, so beautiful and lovely to look upon. And yet if
          one should choose to devote his attention to these and think fit to
          describe every one of them, he would have to draw on almost the
          whole stream of Homer's poetry and still he would be short of
          words, and the panegyrics that have been composed for all the
          demi-gods would be inadequate for your sole praise. First, then,
          let me begin, if you please, with your sceptre and your sovereignty
          itself. For what does the poet say when he wishes to praise the
          antiquity of the house of the Pelopids and to exhibit the greatness
          of their sovereignty?)</p>

          riding-horses. And as for their fastest runner, it is an open

          they hold their ground when they encountered the foe. You, however,
          engaged in countless battles, not only with hostile barbarians in
          great numbers, but with just as many of your own subjects, who had
          revolted and were fighting on the side of one who was ambitious of
          grasping the imperial power; yet your phalanx remained unbroken and
          never wavered or yielded an inch. That this is not an idle boast
          and that I do not make a pretension in words that goes beyond the
          actual facts, I will demonstrate to my hearers. For I think it
          would be absurd to relate to you your own achievements. I should be
          like a stupid and tasteless person who, on seeing the works of
          Pheidias should attempt to discuss with Pheidias himself the Maiden
          Goddess on the Acropolis, or the statue of Zeus at Pisa. But if I
          publish to the rest of the world your most distinguished
          achievements, I shall perhaps avoid that blunder and not lay myself
          open to criticism. So I will hesitate no more but proceed with my

          stood in his way, but all things stood aside and made a path for
          him in their joy. Even so the usurper thought that he had left
          behind him nothing hostile or opposed to him, and that there was
          nothing at all to hinder him from taking up a position at the mouth
          of the Tigris. And there followed him a large force of heavy
          infantry and as many cavalry, yes, and good fighters they were,
          Celts, Iberians and Germans from the banks of the Rhine and from
          the coasts of the western sea. Whether I ought to call that sea the
          Ocean or the Atlantic, or whether it is proper to use some other
          name for it, I am not sure. I only know that its coasts are peopled
          by tribes of barbarians who are not easy to subdue and are far more
          energetic than any other race, and I know it not merely from
          hearsay, on which it is never safe to rely, but I have learned it
          from personal experience. From these tribes, then, he mustered an
          army as large as that which marched with him from home, or rather
          many followed him because they were his own people, allied to him
          by the ties of race, but our subjects—for so we must call them—I
          mean all his Roman troops followed from compulsion and not from
          choice, like mercenary allies, and their position and <span class=

          the barbarian that he was, in his insensate folly, though he did
          not, like Capaneus, trust to the energy of his soul or his physical
          strength, but to the numbers of his barbarian followers; and he
          boasted that he would lay everything at their feet to plunder, that
          every general and captain and common soldier of his should despoil
          an enemy of corresponding rank of his baggage and belongings, and
          that he would enslave the owners as well. He was confirmed in this
          attitude by the Emperor's clever strategy, and led his army out
          from the narrow passes to the plains in high spirits and little
          knowing the truth, since he decided that the Emperor's march was
          merely flight and not a manoeuvre. Thus he was taken unawares, like
          a bird or fish in the net. For when he reached the open country and
          the plains of Paeonia, and it seemed advantageous to fight it out
          there, then and not before the Emperor drew up his cavalry
          separately on both wings.)</p>

          some carry lances and are protected by cuirasses and helmets of
          wrought iron mail. They wear greaves that fit the legs closely, and
          knee-caps, and on their thighs the same sort of iron covering. They
          ride their horses exactly like statues, and need no shield. In the
          rear of these was posted a large body of the rest of the cavalry,
          who carried shields, while others fought on horseback with bows and
          arrows. Of the infantry the hoplites occupied the centre and
          supported the cavalry on either wing. In their rear were the
          slingers and archers and all troops that shoot their missiles from
          the hand and have neither shield nor cuirass. This, then, was the
          disposition of our phalanx. The left wing slightly outflanked the
          enemy, whose whole force was thereby thrown into confusion, and
          their line broke. When our cavalry made a charge and maintained it
          stubbornly, he who had so shamefully usurped the imperial power
          disgraced himself by flight, and left there his cavalry commander

          indeed he enjoyed success, and at his first attempt met with no
          repulse or failure, but on that day he provoked the punishment that
          justice had in store for his misdeeds, and had to pay a penalty
          that is hardly credible. For all the others who abetted the usurper
          in that war met death openly or their flight was evident to all, as
          was the repentance of others. For many came as suppliants, and all
          obtained forgiveness, since the Emperor surpassed the son of Thetis
          in generosity. For Achilles, after Patroclus fell, refused any
          longer even to sell those whom he took captive, but slew them as
          they clasped his knees and begged for mercy. But the Emperor
          proclaimed an amnesty for those who should renounce the conspiracy,
          and so not only freed them from the fear of death or exile or some
          other punishment, but, as though their association with the usurper
          had been due to some misadventure or unhappy error, he deigned to
          reinstate them and completely cancel the past. I shall have
          occasion to refer to this again.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(But what I must
          now state is that the man who had trained and tutored the usurper
          was neither among the fallen nor the fugitives. It was indeed
          natural that he should not even hope for pardon, since his schemes
          had been so wicked, his actions so infamous, and he had been
          responsible for the slaughter of so many innocent men and women, of
          whom many were private citizens, and of almost all who were
          connected with the imperial family. And he had done this not with
          shrinking nor with the sentiments of one who sheds the blood of his
          own people, and because of that stain of guilt fears and is on the
          watch for the avenger and those who will exact a bloody reckoning,
          but, with a kind of purification that was new and unheard of, he
          would wash his hands of the blood of his first victims, and then go
          on to murder man after man, and then, after those whom they held
          dear, he slew the women as well. So he naturally abandoned the idea
          of appealing for mercy. But likely as it is that he should think
          thus, yet it may well be otherwise For the fact is that we do not
          know what he did or suffered before he vanished out of sight, out
          of our ken. Whether some avenging deity snatched him away, as Homer
          says of the daughters of Pandareos,<a id="noteref_269" name=

          even now is carrying him to the very verge of the world to punish
          him for his evil designs, or whether the river<a id="noteref_270"
          name="noteref_270" href="#note_270"><span class=

          received him and bids him feed the fishes, has not yet been
          revealed. For till the battle actually began, and while the troops
          were forming the phalanx, he was full of confidence and went to and
          fro in the centre of their line. But when the battle was ended as
          was fitting, he vanished completely, taken from our sight by I know
          not what god or supernatural agency, only it is quite certain that
          the fate in store for him was far from enviable. At any rate he was
          not destined to appear again, and, after insulting us with
          impunity, live prosperous and secure as he thought he should; but
          he was doomed to be completely blotted out and to suffer a
          punishment that for him indeed was fatal but to many was beneficial
          and gave them a chance of recovery.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(Now though it
          would be well worth while to devote more of my speech to this man
          who was the author of that whole enterprise, yet it breaks the
          thread of my narrative, which had reached the thick of the action.
          So I must leave that subject for the present, and going back to the
          point where I digressed, describe how the battle ended. For though
          their generals showed such cowardice, the courage of the soldiers
          was by no means abated. When their line was broken, which was due
          not to their cowardice but to the ignorance and inexperience of
          their leader, they formed into companies and kept up the fight. And
          what happened then was beyond all expectation; for the enemy
          refused altogether to yield to those who were defeating them, while
          our men did their utmost to achieve a signal victory, and so there
          arose the wildest confusion, loud shouts mingled with the din of
          weapons, as swords were shattered against helmets and shields
          against spears. It was a hand to hand fight, in which they
          discarded their shields and attacked with swords only, while,
          indifferent to their own fate, and devoting the utmost ardour to
          inflicting severe loss on the foe, they were ready to meet even
          death if only they could make our victory seem doubtful and dearly
          bought. It was not only the infantry who behaved thus to their
          pursuers, but even the cavalry, whose spears were broken and were
          now entirely useless. Their shafts are long and polished, and when
          they had broken them they dismounted and transformed themselves
          into hoplites. So for some time they held their own against the
          greatest odds. But since our cavalry kept shooting their arrows
          from a distance as they rode after them, while the cuirassiers made
          frequent charges, as was easy on that unobstructed and level plain,
          and moreover night overtook them, the enemy were glad at last to
          take to flight, while our men kept up a vigorous pursuit as far as
          the camp and took it by assault, together with the baggage and
          slaves and baggage animals. Directly the rout of the enemy had
          begun, as I have described, and while we kept up a hot pursuit,
          they were driven towards the left, where the river was on the right
          of the victors. And there the greatest slaughter took place, and
          the river was choked with the bodies of men and horses,
          indiscriminately. For the Drave was not like the Scamander, nor so
          kind to the fugitives; it did not put ashore and cast forth from
          its waters the dead in their armour, nor cover up and hide securely
          in its eddies those who escaped alive. For that is what the Trojan
          river did<a id="noteref_277" name="noteref_277" href=
          "#note_277"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">277</span></span></a>,
          perhaps out of kindness, perhaps it was only that it was so small
          that it offered an easy crossing to one who tried to swim or walk.
          In fact, when a single poplar was thrown into it, it formed a
          bridge,<a id="noteref_278" name="noteref_278" href=
          "#note_278"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">278</span></span></a> and
          the whole river roared with foam and blood and beat upon the
          shoulders of Achilles,<a id="noteref_279" name="noteref_279" href=
          "#note_279"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">279</span></span></a> if
          indeed we may believe even this, but it never did anything more
          violent. When a slight fire scorched it, it gave up fighting at
          once and swore not to play the part of ally. However this, too, was
          probably a jest on Homer's part, when he invented that strange and
          unnatural sort of duel. For in the rest of the poem also he
          evidently favours Achilles, and he sets the army there as mere
          spectators while he brings Achilles on to the field as the only
          invincible and resistless warrior, and makes him slay all whom he
          encounters and put every one of the foe to flight, simply by his
          voice and bearing and the glance of his eyes, both when the battle
          begins and on the banks of the Scamander, till the fugitives were
          glad to gather within the wall of the city. Many verses he devotes
          to relating this, and then he invents the battles of the gods, and
          by embellishing his poem with such tales he corrupts his critics
          and prevents us from giving a fair and honest vote. But if there be
          any one who refuses to be beguiled by the beauty of the words and
          the fictions that are imported into the poem ...<a id="noteref_280"

          then, though he is as strict as a member of the Areopagus, I shall
          not dread his decision. For we are convinced by the poem that the
          son of Peleus is a brave soldier. He slays twenty men; then)</p>

          name, though it has also been named after King Antiochus. Then,
          too, it has another, a barbarian name<a id="noteref_288" name=

          is familiar to many of you from your intercourse with the
          barbarians of those parts. This city was besieged by an
          overwhelming number of Parthians with their Indian allies, at the
          very time when the Emperor was prepared to march against the
          usurper. And like the sea crab which they say engaged Heracles in
          battle when he sallied forth to attack the Lernaean monster,<a id=
          "noteref_289" name="noteref_289" href="#note_289"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">289</span></span></a> the
          King of the Parthians, crossing the Tigris from the mainland,
          encircled the city with dykes. Then he let the Mygdonius flow into
          these, and transformed all the space about the city into a lake,
          and completely hemmed it in as though it were an island, so that
          only the ramparts stood out and showed a little above the water.
          Then he besieged it by bringing up ships with siege-engines on
          board. This was not the work of a day, but I believe of almost four
          months. But the defenders within the wall continually repulsed the
          barbarians by burning the siege-engines with their fire-darts. And
          from the wall they hauled up many of the ships, while others were
          shattered by the force of the engines when discharged and the
          weight of the missiles. For some of the stones that were hurled on
          to them weighed as much as seven Attic talents.<a id="noteref_290"

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">290</span></span></a> When
          this had been going on for many days in succession, part of the
          dyke gave way and the water flowed in in full tide, carrying with
          it a portion of the wall as much as a hundred cubits long.<a id=

          arrayed the besieging army in the Persian fashion. For they keep up
          and imitate Persian customs, I suppose, because they do not wish to
          be considered Parthians, and so pretend to be Persians. That is
          surely the reason why they prefer the Persian manner of dress. And
          when they march to battle they look like them, and take pride in
          wearing the same armour, and raiment adorned with gold and purple.
          By this means they try to evade the truth and to make it appear
          that they have not revolted from Macedon, but are merely resuming
          the empire that was theirs of old. Their king, therefore, imitating
          Xerxes, sat on a sort of hill that had been artificially made, and
          his army advanced accompanied by their beasts.<a id="noteref_294"

          came from India and carried iron towers full of archers. First came
          the cavalry who wore cuirasses, and the archers, and then the rest
          of the cavalry in huge numbers. For infantry they find useless for
          their sort of fighting and it is not highly regarded by them. Nor,
          in fact, is it necessary to them, since the whole of the country
          that they inhabit is flat and bare. For a military force is
          naturally valued or slighted in proportion to its actual usefulness
          in war. Accordingly, since infantry is, from the nature of the
          country, of little use to them, it is granted no great
          consideration in their laws. This happened in the case of Crete and
          Caria as well, and countless nations have a military equipment like
          theirs. For instance the plains of Thessaly have proved suitable
          for cavalry engagements and drill. Our state, on the other hand,
          since it has had to encounter adversaries of all sorts, and has won
          its pre-eminence by good judgment combined with good luck, has
          naturally adapted itself to every kind of armour, and to a varying
          equipment.)</p>

          Parthians advanced to attack the wall in their splendid
          accoutrements, men and horses, supported by the Indian elephants,
          it was with the utmost confidence that they would at once take it
          by assault. And at the signal to charge they all pressed forward,
          since every man of them was eager to be the first to scale the
          wall<a id="noteref_299" name="noteref_299" href=

          win the glory of that exploit. They did not imagine that there was
          anything to fear, nor did they believe that the besieged would
          resist their assault. Such was the exaggerated confidence of the
          Parthians. The besieged, however, kept their phalanx unbroken at
          the gap in the wall, and on the portion of the wall that was still
          intact they posted all the non-combatants in the city, and
          distributed among them an equal number of soldiers. But when the
          enemy rode up and not a single missile was hurled at them from the
          wall, their confidence that they would completely reduce the city
          was strengthened, and they whipped and spurred on their horses so
          that their flanks were covered with blood, until they had left the
          dykes behind them. These dykes they had made earlier to dam the
          mouth of the Mygdonius, and the mud thereabouts was very deep. In
          fact there was hardly any ground at all because of the wood,<a id=

          because the soil was so rich, and of the sort that conceals springs
          under its surface. Moreover there was in that place a wide moat
          that had been made long ago to protect the town, and had become
          filled up with a bog of considerable depth. Now when the enemy had
          already reached this moat and were trying to cross it, a large
          force of the besieged made a sally, while many others hurled stones
          from the walls. Then many of the besiegers were slain, and all with
          one accord turned their horses in flight, though only from their
          gestures could it be seen that flight was what they desired and
          intended. For, as they were in the act of wheeling them about,
          their horses fell and bore down the riders with them. Weighed down
          as they were by their armour, they floundered still deeper in the
          bog, and the carnage that ensued has never yet been paralleled in
          any siege of the same kind.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(Since this fate
          had overtaken the cavalry, they tried the elephants, thinking that
          they would be more likely to overawe us by that novel sort of
          fighting. For surely they had not been stricken so blind as not to
          see that an elephant is heavier than a horse, since it carries the
          load, not of two horses or several, but what would, I suppose,
          require many waggons, I mean archers and javelin men and the iron
          tower besides. All this was a serious hindrance, considering that
          the ground was artificially made and had been converted into a bog.
          And this the event made plain. Hence it is probable that they were
          not advancing to give battle, but rather were arrayed to overawe
          the besieged. They came on in battle line at equal distances from
          one another, in fact the phalanx of the Parthians resembled a wall,
          with the elephants carrying the towers, and hoplites filling up the
          spaces between. But drawn up as these were they were of no great
          use to the barbarian. It was, however, a spectacle which gave the
          defenders on the wall great pleasure and entertainment, and when
          they had gazed their fill at what resembled a splendid and costly
          pageant in procession, they hurled stones from their engines, and,
          shooting their arrows, challenged the barbarians to fight for the
          wall. Now the Parthians are naturally quick-tempered, and they
          could not endure to incur ridicule and lead back this imposing
          force without striking a blow; so by the king's express command
          they charged at the wall and received a continuous fire of stones
          and arrows, while some of the elephants were wounded, and perished
          by sinking into the mud. Thereupon, in fear for the others also,
          they led them back to the camp.)</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(Having failed
          in this second attempt as well, the Parthian king divided his
          archers into companies and ordered them to relieve one another and
          to keep shooting at the breach in the wall, so that the beseiged
          could not rebuild it and thus ensure the safety of the town. For he
          hoped by this means either to take it by surprise, or by mere
          numbers to overwhelm the garrison. But the preparations that had
          been made by the Emperor made it clear that the barbarian's plan
          was futile. For in the rear of the hoplites a second wall was being
          built, and while he thought they were using the old line of the
          wall for the foundations and that the work was not yet in hand,
          they had laboured continuously for a whole day and night till the
          wall had risen to a height of four cubits. And at daybreak it
          became visible, a new and conspicuous piece of work. Moreover the
          besieged did not for a moment yield their ground, but kept
          relieving one another and shooting their javelins at those who were
          attacking the fallen wall, and all this terribly dismayed the
          barbarian. Nevertheless he did not at once lead off his army but
          employed the same efforts over again. But when he had done as
          before, and as before suffered repulse, he did lead his army back,
          having lost many whole tribes through famine, and squandered many
          lives over the dykes and in the siege. He had also put to death
          many satraps one after another, on various charges, blaming one of
          them because the dykes had not been made strong enough, but gave
          way and were flooded by the waters of the river, another because
          when fighting under the walls he had not distinguished himself; and
          others he executed for one offence or another. This is in fact the
          regular custom among the barbarians in Asia, to shift the blame of
          their ill-success on to their subjects. Thus then the king acted on
          that occasion, and afterwards took himself off. And from that time
          he has kept the peace with us and has never asked for any covenant
          or treaty, but he stays at home and is thankful if only the Emperor
          does not march against him and exact vengeance for his audacity and
          folly.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(And now am I
          justified in comparing this battle with those that were fought in
          defence of the Greek ships and the wall? Observe the following
          points of similarity, and note also the difference. Of the Greeks
          the two Ajaxes, the Lapithae and Menestheus fell back from the wall
          and looked on helplessly while the gates were battered down by
          Hector, and Sarpedon scaled the battlements. But our garrison did
          not give way even when the wall fell in of itself, but they fought
          and won, and repulsed the Parthians, aided though these were by
          their Indian allies. Then again Hector went up on to the ships and
          fought from their decks on foot, and as though from behind a
          rampart, whereas our garrison first had to fight a naval battle
          from the walls, and finally, while Hector and Sarpedon had to
          retreat from the battlements and the ships, the garrison routed not
          only the forces that brought ships to the attack but the land force
          as well. Now it is appropriate that by some happy chance my speech
          should have alluded to Hector and Sarpedon, and to what I may call
          the very crown of their achievements, I mean the destruction of
          that wall which Homer tells us the Achaeans built only the day

          likely that Zeus would give such base and cowardly advice,
          especially to one who was not even fighting, but was standing there
          very much at his ease? And while the son of Tydeus, on whose head
          Athene kindled a mighty flame, was slaying many and forcing to
          flight all who stayed to encounter him, Hector stood far away from
          the battle. Though he had to endure many taunts, he despaired of
          making a stand against the Achaeans, but made a specious excuse for
          going to the city to advise his mother to propitiate Athene in
          company with the Trojan women. And yet if in person he had besought
          the goddess before the temple, with the elders, he would have had
          good reason for that, for it is only proper, in my opinion, that a
          general or king should always serve the god with the appointed

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(For here I
          think I may without offence adapt slightly Plato's language where
          he says that the man, and especially the king, best equipped for
          this life is he who depends on God for all that relates to
          happiness, and does not hang in suspense on other men, whose
          actions, whether good or bad, are liable to force him and his
          affairs out of the straight path.<a id="noteref_318" name=

          though no one should allow me to paraphrase or change that passage
          or alter that word,<a id="noteref_319" name="noteref_319" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">319</span></span></a> and
          though I should be told that I must leave it undisturbed like
          something holy and consecrated by time, even in that case I shall
          maintain that this is what that wise man meant. For when he says
          <span class="tei tei-q">“depends on himself,”</span> assuredly he
          does not refer to a man's body or his property, or long descent, or
          distinguished ancestors. For these are indeed his belongings, but
          they are not the man himself; his real self is his mind, his
          intelligence, and, in a word, the god that is in us. As to which,
          Plato elsewhere calls it <span class="tei tei-q">“the supreme form
          of the soul that is within us,”</span> and says that <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“God has given it to each one of us as a guiding
          genius, even that which we say dwells in the summit of our body and
          raises us from earth towards our celestial affinity.”</span><a id=
          "noteref_320" name="noteref_320" href="#note_320"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">320</span></span></a> It is
          on this that he plainly says every man ought to depend, and not on
          other men, who have so often succeeded when they wish to harm and
          hinder us in other respects. Indeed it has happened before now that
          even without such a desire men have deprived us of certain of our
          possessions. But this alone cannot be hindered or harmed, since
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Heaven does not permit the bad to injure
          what is better than itself.”</span><a id="noteref_321" name=
          "noteref_321" href="#note_321"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">321</span></span></a> This
          saying also is from Plato. But it may be that I am wearying you
          with these doctrines of his with which I sprinkle my own utterances
          in small quantities, as with salt or gold dust. For salt makes our
          food more agreeable, and gold enhances an effect to the eye. But
          Plato's doctrines produce both effects. For as we listen to them
          they give more pleasure than salt to the sense, and they have a
          wonderful power of sweetly nourishing and cleansing the soul. So
          that I must not hesitate or be cautious of criticism if someone
          reproaches me with being insatiable and grasping at everything,
          like persons at a banquet who, in their greed to taste every dish,
          cannot keep their hands from what is set before them.<a id=

          something of this sort seems to happen in my case when, in the same
          breath, I utter panegyric and philosophic theories, and, before I
          have done justice to my original theme, break off in the middle to
          expound the sayings of philosophers. I have had occasion before now
          to reply to those who make such criticisms as these, and perhaps I
          shall have to do so again.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(I will now,
          however, resume the thread of my discourse and go back to my
          starting-point, like those who, when a race is being started, run
          ahead out of the line. Well, I was saying, a moment ago, that Plato
          declares that a man's real self is his mind and soul, whereas his
          body and his estate are but his possessions. This is the
          distinction made in that marvellous work, the Laws. And so if one
          were to go back to the beginning and say <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“That man is best equipped for life who makes
          everything that relates to happiness depend on his mind and
          intelligence and not on those outside himself who, by doing or
          faring well or ill force him out of the straight path,”</span> he
          is not changing or perverting the sense of the words, but expounds
          and interprets them correctly. And if for Plato's word <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“genius”</span><a id="noteref_325" name="noteref_325"
          href="#note_325"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">325</span></span></a> he
          substitutes the word <span class="tei tei-q">“God”</span> he has a
          perfect right to do so. For if Plato gives the control of our whole
          life to the presiding <span class="tei tei-q">“genius”</span>
          within us which is by nature unaffected by sensation and akin to
          God, but must endure and suffer much because of its association
          with the body, and therefore gives the impression to the crowd that
          it also is subject to sensation and death; and if he says that this
          is true of every man who wishes to be happy, what must we suppose
          is his opinion about pure intelligence unmixed with earthly
          substance, which is indeed synonymous with God? To this I say every
          man, whether he be a private citizen or a king, ought to entrust
          the reins of his life, and by a king I mean one who is really
          worthy of the name, and not counterfeit or falsely so called, but
          one who is aware of God and discerns his nature because of his
          affinity with him, and being truly wise bows to the divine
          authority and yields the supremacy to God. For it is senseless and
          arrogant indeed for those who cultivate virtue not to submit to God
          once and for all, as far as possible. For we must believe that this
          above all else is what God approves. Again, no man must neglect the
          traditional form of worship or lightly regard this method of paying
          honour to the higher power, but rather consider that to be virtuous
          is to be scrupulously devout. For Piety is the child of Justice,
          and that justice is a characteristic of the more divine type of
          soul is obvious to all who discuss such matters.)</p>

          reason, then, while I applaud Hector for refusing to make a
          libation because of the blood-stains on his hands, he had, as I
          said, no right to go back to the city or forsake the battle, seeing
          that the task he was about to perform was not that of a general or
          of a king, but of a messenger and underling, and that he was ready
          to take on himself the office of an Idaeus or Talthybius. However,
          as I said at first, this seems to have been simply a specious
          excuse for flight. And indeed when he obeyed the bidding of the

          Sarpedon. Shall I therefore shrink from competition as though I
          could not cite on behalf of the Emperor any such exploit, and must
          therefore avoid seeming to compare the trivial with the important
          and things of little account with what deserves more serious
          consideration, or shall I venture to enter the lists even against
          an achievement so famous? Now that wall was to protect the beach,
          and was a palisade such as we are wont to construct, and was
          completed in less than a morning. But the wall that was on the Alps
          was an ancient fort, and the usurper used it after his flight,
          converting it into a defence as strong as though it had been newly
          built, and he left there an ample garrison of seasoned troops. But
          he did not himself march all the way there, but remained in the
          neighbouring city.<a id="noteref_331" name="noteref_331" href=

          is a trading centre of the Italians on the coast, very prosperous
          and teeming with wealth, since the Mysians and Paeonians and all
          the Italian inhabitants of the interior procure their merchandise
          thence. These last used, I think, to be called Heneti in the past,
          but now that the Romans are in possession of these cities they
          preserve the original name, but make the trifling addition of one
          letter at the beginning of the word. Its sign is a single
          character<a id="noteref_332" name="noteref_332" href=
          "#note_332"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          they call it <span class="tei tei-q">“oo,”</span> and they often
          use it instead of <span class="tei tei-q">“b,”</span> to serve, I
          suppose, as a sort of breathing, and to represent some peculiarity
          of their pronunciation. The nation as a whole is called by this
          name, but at the time of the founding of the city an eagle from
          Zeus flew past on the right, and so bestowed on the place the omen
          derived from the bird.<a id="noteref_333" name="noteref_333" href=
          "#note_333"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          situated at the foot of the Alps, which are very high mountains
          with precipices in them, and they hardly allow room for those who
          are trying to force their way over the passes to use even a single
          waggon and a pair of mules. They begin at the sea which we call
          Ionian, and form a barrier between what is now Italy and the
          Illyrians and Galatians, and extend as far as the Etruscan sea. For
          when the Romans conquered the whole of this country, which includes
          the tribe of the Heneti and some of the Ligurians and a
          considerable number of Galatians besides, they did not hinder them
          from retaining their ancient names, but compelled them to
          acknowledge the dominion of the Italian republic. And, in our day,
          all the territory that lies within the Alps and is bounded by the
          Ionian and the Etruscan seas has the honour of being called Italy.
          On the other side of the Alps, on the west, dwell the Galatians,
          and the Rhaetians to the north where the Rhine and the Danube have
          their sources hard by in the neighbouring country of the
          barbarians. And on the east, as I said, the Alps fortify the
          district where the usurper stationed his garrison. In this way,
          then, Italy is contained on all sides, partly by mountains that are
          very hard to cross, partly by a shallow sea into which countless
          streams empty and form a morass like the marshlands of Egypt. But
          the Emperor by his skill gained control of the whole of that
          boundary of the sea, and forced his way inland.)</p>

          storming it, because the country all about was terribly short of

          he took it by storm, and you will be content to hear no more from
          me. However I will add this merely, that Alexander in storming the
          rock lost many of his Macedonians, whereas our ruler and general
          lost not a single chiliarch or a captain, nay not even a legionary
          from the muster-roll, but achieved an unsullied and <span class=

          victory. Now Hector and Sarpedon, no doubt, hurled down many men
          from the wall, but when they encountered Patroclus in all his glory
          Sarpedon was slain near the ships, while Hector, to his shame, fled
          without even recovering the body of his friend. Thus without
          intelligence and emboldened by mere physical strength they ventured
          to attack the wall. But the Emperor, when strength and daring are
          required, employs force of arms and good counsel together, and so
          wins the day, but where good judgment alone is necessary it is by
          this that he steers his course, and thus achieves triumphs such as

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(But to try to
          count up the nations who lately marched with the Emperor and fought
          on his side in the war, would be idle talk, superfluous verbiage,
          and absurd simplicity. And it is natural that, in proportion as the
          armies are larger, their achievements are more important. So it
          follows of necessity that, in this respect as well, the Emperor's
          army surpassed Homer's heroes. In mere numbers, at any rate, at
          what point, I ask, could one justly compare them? For the Greeks
          fought all along for a single city and the Trojans when they
          prevailed were not able to drive away the Greeks, nor were the
          Greeks strong enough, when they won a victory, to destroy and
          overthrow the power and the royal sway of the house of Priam, and
          yet the time they spent over it was ten years long. But the
          Emperor's wars and undertakings have been numerous. He has been
          described as waging war against the Germans across the Rhine, and
          then there was his bridge of boats over the Tigris, and his
          exposure of the power and arrogance of the Parthians<a id=

          no trivial thing, on that occasion when they did not venture to
          defend their country while he was laying it waste, but had to look
          on while the whole of it was devastated between the Tigris and the
          Lycus. Then, when the war against the usurper was concluded, there
          followed the expeditions to Sicily and Carthage, and that stratagem
          of occupying beforehand the mouth of the Po, which deprived the
          usurper of all his forces in Italy, and finally that third and last
          fall<a id="noteref_349" name="noteref_349" href=

          the Cottian Alps, which secured for the Emperor the pleasure of a
          victory that was sure, and carried with it no fears for the future,
          while it compelled the defeated man to inflict on himself a just
          penalty wholly worthy of his misdeeds.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(I have given
          this brief account of the Emperor's achievements, not adding
          anything in flattery and trying to exaggerate things that are
          perhaps of no special importance, nor dragging in what is
          far-fetched and unduly pressing points of resemblance with those
          achievements, like those who interpret the myths of the poets and
          analyse them into plausible versions which allow them to introduce
          fictions of their own, though they start out from very slight
          analogies, and having recourse to a very shadowy basis, try to
          convince us that this is the very thing that the poets intended to
          say. But in this case if anyone should take out of Homer's poems
          merely the names of the heroes, and insert and fit in the
          Emperor's, the epic of the Iliad would be seen to have been
          composed quite as much in his honour as in theirs.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(But that you
          may not think, if you hear only about his achievements and
          successes in war, that the Emperor is less well endowed for
          pursuits that are loftier and rightly considered of more
          importance, I mean public speaking and deliberations and all those
          affairs in which judgment combined with intelligence and prudence
          take the helm, consider the case of Odysseus and Nestor, who are so
          highly praised in the poem; and if you find that the Emperor is
          inferior to them in any respect, put that down to his panegyrists,
          but we should rather in fairness concede that he is far superior.
          Nestor, for instance, when they began to disagree and quarrel about
          the captive damsel,<a id="noteref_358" name="noteref_358" href=
          "#note_358"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">358</span></span></a> tried
          to address them, and he did persuade the king and the son of
          Thetis, but only to this extent that Achilles broke up the assembly
          in disorder, while Agamemnon did not even wait to complete his
          expiation to the god, but while he was still performing the rite
          and the sacred ship was in view, he sent heralds to the tent of
          Achilles, just as though, it seems to me, he were afraid that he
          would forget his anger, and, once free from that passion, would
          repent and avoid his error. Again, the far-travelled orator from
          Ithaca, when he tried to persuade Achilles to make peace, and
          offered him many gifts and promised him countless others, so
          provoked the young warrior that, though he had not before planned
          to sail home, he now began to make preparations.<a id="noteref_359"
          name="noteref_359" href="#note_359"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">359</span></span></a> Then
          there are those wonderful proofs of their intelligence, their
          exhortations to battle and Nestor's building of the wall, a
          cowardly notion and worthy indeed of an old man. Nor in truth did
          the Achaeans benefit much from that device. For it was after they
          had finished the wall that they were worsted by the Trojans, and
          naturally enough. For before that, they thought that they were
          themselves protecting the ships, like a noble bulwark. But when
          they realised that a wall lay in front of them, built with a deep
          moat and set at intervals with sharp stakes, they grew careless and
          slackened their valour, because they trusted to the fortification.
          Yet it is not anyone who blames them and shows that they were in
          the wrong who is therefore a fit and proper person to praise the
          Emperor. But he who, in a worthy manner, recounts the Emperor's
          deeds, which were done not idly or automatically, or from an
          irrational impulse, but were skilfully planned beforehand and
          carried through, he alone praises adequately the Emperor's keen
          intelligence.)</p>

          persuaded by mere youths to think childish thoughts, forgot his
          treaties and obligations and proved to be the enemy of his
          preserver and benefactor, and came to terms with one against whom
          the Emperor was waging a war that allowed no truce nor herald of a
          truce,<a id="noteref_367" name="noteref_367" href=
          "#note_367"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          who was not only getting an army together, but came to meet the
          Emperor on the border of the country, because he was anxious to
          hinder him from advancing further. And when those two armies met,
          and it was necessary to hold an assembly in the presence of the
          hoplites, a high platform was set up and it was surrounded by a
          crowd of hoplites, javelin-men and archers and cavalry equipped
          with their horses and the standards of the divisions. Then the
          Emperor, accompanied by him who for the moment was his colleague,
          mounted the platform, carrying no sword or shield or helmet, but
          wearing his usual dress. And not even one of his bodyguard followed
          him, but there he stood alone on the platform, trusting to that
          speech which was so impressively appropriate. For of speeches too
          he is a good craftsman, though he does not plane down and polish
          his phrases nor elaborate his periods like the ingenious
          rhetoricians, but is at once dignified and simple, and uses the
          right words on every occasion, so that they sink into the souls not
          only of those who claim to be cultured and intelligent, but many
          unlearned persons too understand and give hearing to his words. And
          so he won over many tens of thousands of hoplites and twenty
          thousand cavalry and most warlike nations, and at the same time a
          country that is extremely fertile, not seizing it by force, or
          carrying off captives, but by winning over men who obeyed him of
          their own free will and were eager to carry out his orders. This
          victory I judge to be far more splendid than that for which Sparta
          is famous.<a id="noteref_368" name="noteref_368" href=

          though it were an ancestral debt. And all else the Emperor gave him
          in abundance, more than they say Cyrus gave to his grandfather, and
          arranged that he should live and be maintained in the manner that
          Homer recommends for men who are past their prime:—)</p>

          I should have been glad to repeat to you the words that the Emperor

          time should remember it by heart, and demand from me not only the
          ideas in it but all the excellences with which they are adorned,

          this at any rate Homer had not to fear when, many generations
          later, he reported his speeches, since his speakers left no record
          of what they said in their assemblies, and I think he was clearly
          confident that he was able to relate and report what they said in a
          better style. But to make an inferior copy is absurd and unworthy
          of a generous and noble soul. Now as to the marvellous portion of
          his achievements and those of which the great multitude was
          spectator and hence preserves their memory and commends them, since
          it looks to the result and is there to judge whether they turn out
          well or ill, and eulogises them in language that is certainly not
          elegant,—as to all this I say you have often heard from the
          ingenious sophists, and from the race of poets inspired by the
          Muses themselves, so that, as far as these are concerned, I must
          have wearied you by speaking about them at too great length. For
          you are already surfeited with them, your ears are filled with
          them, and there will always be a supply of composers of such
          discourses to sing of battles and proclaim victories with a loud
          clear voice, after the manner of the heralds at the Olympic games.
          For you yourselves, since you delight to listen to them, have
          produced an abundance of these men. And no wonder. For their
          conceptions of what is good and bad are akin to your own, and they
          do but report to you your own opinions and depict them in fine
          phrases, like a dress of many colours, and cast them into the mould
          of agreeable rhythms and forms, and bring them forth for you as
          though they had invented something new. And you welcome them
          eagerly, and think that this is the correct way to eulogise, and
          you say that these deeds have received their due. And this is
          perhaps true but it may well be otherwise, since you do not really
          know what the correct way should be.)</p>

          or ingenious, or able, though each one could lay claim to only one
          small fraction of virtue, to impose on the masses, these too he
          would not praise without reserve. And his judgment is followed by a
          host of wise men who reverence virtue, but as for all those wonders
          and marvels that I have described, some say of them that they are
          worth little, others that they are worth nothing.)</p>

          are of their opinion, I feel no inconsiderable alarm for what I
          said earlier, and for myself, lest possibly you should declare that
          my words are mere childishness, and that I am an absurd and
          ignorant sophist and make pretensions to an art in which I confess
          that I have no skill, as indeed I must confess to you when I recite
          eulogies that are really deserved, and such as you think it worth
          while to listen to, even though they should seem to most of you
          somewhat uncouth and far inferior to what has been already uttered.
          But if, as I said before, you accept the authors of those other
          eulogies, then my fear is altogether allayed. For then I shall not
          seem wholly out of place, but though, as I admit, inferior to many
          others, yet judged by my own standard, not wholly unprofitable nor
          attempting what is out of place. And indeed it is probably not easy
          for you to disbelieve wise and inspired men who have much to say,
          each in his own manner, though the sum and substance of all their
          speeches is the praise of virtue. And virtue they say is implanted
          in the soul and makes it happy and kingly, yes, by Zeus, and
          statesmanlike and gifted with true generalship, and generous and

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(For there is
          nothing at all superior to it, nothing that can constrain and
          control it, or take it from him who has once possessed it. Indeed
          it seems to me that this possession bears the same relation to the
          soul as its light to the sun. For often men have stolen the votive
          offerings of the Sun and destroyed his temples and gone their way,
          and some have been punished, and others let alone as not worthy of
          the punishment that leads to amendment. But his light no one ever
          takes from the sun, not even the moon when in their conjunctions
          she oversteps his disc, or when she takes his rays to herself, and
          often, as the saying is, turns midday into night.<a id=
          "noteref_398" name="noteref_398" href="#note_398"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">398</span></span></a> Nor
          is he deprived of his light when he illumines the moon in her
          station opposite to himself and shares with her his own nature, nor
          when he fills with light and day this great and wonderful universe.
          Just so no good man who imparts his goodness to another was ever
          thought to have less virtue by as much as he had bestowed. So
          divine and excellent is that possession, and most true is the
          saying of the Athenian stranger, whoever that inspired man may have
          been: <span class="tei tei-q">“All the gold beneath the earth and
          above ground is too little to give in exchange for
          virtue.”</span><a id="noteref_399" name="noteref_399" href=
          "#note_399"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">399</span></span></a> Let
          us therefore now boldly call its possessor wealthy, yes and I
          should say well-born also, and the only king among them all,<a id=
          "noteref_400" name="noteref_400" href="#note_400"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">400</span></span></a> if
          anyone agree to this. For as noble birth is better than a lowly
          pedigree, so virtue is better than a character not in all respects
          admirable. And let no one say that this statement is contentious
          and too strong, judging by the ordinary use of words. For the
          multitude are wont to say that the sons of those who have long been
          rich are well-born. And yet is it not extraordinary that a cook or
          cobbler, yes, by Zeus, or some potter who has got money together by
          his craft, or by some other means, is not considered well-born nor
          is given that title by the many, whereas if this man's son inherit
          his estate and hand it on to his sons, they begin to give
          themselves airs and compete on the score of noble birth with the
          Pelopids and the Heraclids? Nay, even a man who is born of noble
          ancestors, but himself sinks down in the opposite scale of life,
          could not justly claim kinship with those ancestors, seeing that no
          one could be enrolled among the Pelopids who had not on his
          shoulder the birth-mark<a id="noteref_401" name="noteref_401" href=
          "#note_401"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">401</span></span></a> of
          that family. And in Boeotia it was said that there was the
          impression of a spear on the Sown-men<a id="noteref_402" name=
          "noteref_402" href="#note_402"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">402</span></span></a> from
          the clod of earth that bore and reared them, and that hence the
          race long preserved that distinguishing mark. And can we suppose
          that on men's souls no mark of that sort is engraved, which shall
          tell us accurately who their fathers were and vindicate their birth
          as legitimate? They say that the Celts also have a river<a id=
          "noteref_403" name="noteref_403" href="#note_403"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">403</span></span></a> which
          is an incorruptible judge of offspring, and neither can the mothers
          persuade that river by their laments to hide and conceal their
          fault for them, nor the fathers who are afraid for their wives and
          sons in this trial, but it is an arbiter that never swerves or
          gives a false verdict. But we are corrupted by riches, by physical
          strength in its prime, by powerful ancestors, an influence from
          without that overshadows and does not permit us to see clearly or
          discern the soul; for we are unlike all other living things in
          this, that by the soul and by nothing else, we should with reason
          make our decision about noble birth. And it seems to me that the
          ancients, employing a wondrous sagacity of nature, since their
          wisdom was not like ours a thing acquired, but they were
          philosophers by nature, not manufactured,<a id="noteref_404" name=
          "noteref_404" href="#note_404"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">404</span></span></a>
          perceived the truth of this, and so they called Heracles the son of
          Zeus, and Leda's two sons also, and Minos the law-giver, and
          Rhadamanthus of Cnossus they deemed worthy of the same distinction.
          And many others they proclaimed to be the children of other gods,
          because they so surpassed their mortal parents. For they looked at
          the soul alone and their actual deeds, and not at wealth piled high
          and hoary with age, nor at the power that had come down to them
          from some grandfather or great-grandfather. And yet some of them
          were the sons of fathers not wholly inglorious. But because of the
          superabundance in them of that virtue which men honoured and
          cherished, they were held to be the sons of the gods themselves.
          This is clear from the following fact. In the case of certain
          others, though they did not know those who were by nature their
          sires, they ascribed that title to a divinity, to recompense the
          virtue of those men. And we ought not to say that they were
          deceived, and that in ignorance they told lies about the gods. For
          even if in the case of other gods or deities it was natural that
          they should be so deceived, when they clothed them in human forms
          and human shapes, though those deities possess a nature not to be
          perceived or attained by the senses, but barely recognisable by
          means of pure intelligence, by reason of their kinship with it;
          nevertheless in the case of the visible gods it is not probable
          that they were deceived, for instance, when they entitled Aeetes
          <span class="tei tei-q">“son of Helios”</span> and another<a id=
          "noteref_405" name="noteref_405" href="#note_405"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">405</span></span></a>
          <span class="tei tei-q">“son of the Dawn,”</span> and so on with
          others. But, as I said, we must in these cases believe them, and
          make our enquiry about noble birth accordingly. And when a man has
          virtuous parents and himself resembles them, we may with confidence
          call him nobly born. But when, though his parents lack virtue, he
          himself can claim to possess it, we must suppose that the father
          who begat him is Zeus, and we must not pay less respect to him than
          to those who are the sons of virtuous fathers and emulate their
          parents. But when a bad man comes of good parents, we ought to
          enrol him among the bastards, while as for those who come of a bad
          stock and resemble their parents, never must we call them
          well-born, not even though their wealth amounts to ten thousand
          talents, not though they reckon among their ancestors twenty
          rulers, or, by Zeus, twenty tyrants, not though they can prove that
          the victories they won at Olympia or Pytho or in the encounters of
          war—which are in every way more brilliant than victories in the
          games—were more than the first Caesar's, or can point to
          excavations in Assyria<a id="noteref_406" name="noteref_406" href=
          "#note_406"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">406</span></span></a> or to
          the walls of Babylon and the Egyptian pyramids besides, and to all
          else that is a proof of wealth and great possessions and luxury and
          a soul that is inflamed by ambition and, being at a loss how to use
          money, lavishes on things of that sort all those abundant supplies
          of wealth. For you are well aware that it is not wealth, either
          ancestral or newly acquired and pouring in from some source or
          other, that makes a king, nor his purple cloak nor his tiara and
          sceptre and diadem and ancestral throne, nay nor numerous hoplites
          and ten thousand cavalry; not though all men should gather together
          and acknowledge him for their king, because virtue they cannot
          bestow on him, but only power, ill-omened indeed for him that
          receives it, but still more for those that bestow it. For once he
          has received such power, a man of that sort is altogether raised
          aloft in the clouds, and in nowise differs from the legend of
          Phaethon and his fate. And there is no need of other instances to
          make us believe this saying, for the whole of life is full of such
          disasters and tales about them. And if it seems surprising to you
          that the title of king, so honourable, so favoured by the gods,
          cannot justly be claimed by men who, though they rule over a vast
          territory and nations without number, nevertheless settle questions
          that arise by an autocratic decision, without intelligence or
          wisdom or the virtues that go with wisdom, believe me they are not
          even free men; I do not mean if they merely possess what they have
          with none to hinder them and have their fill of power, but even
          though they conquer all who make war against them, and, when they
          lead an invading army, appear invincible and irresistible. And if
          any of you doubt this statement, I have no lack of notable
          witnesses, Greek and barbarian, who fought and won many mighty
          battles, and became the masters of whole nations and compelled them
          to pay tribute, and yet were themselves slaves in a still more
          shameful degree of pleasure, money and wantonness, insolence and
          injustice. And no man of sense would call them even powerful, not
          though greatness should shine upon and illumine all that they
          achieved. For he alone is strong whose virtue aids him to be brave
          and magnanimous. But he who is the slave of pleasure and cannot
          control his temper and appetites of all sorts, but is compelled to
          succumb to trivial things, is neither brave himself nor strong with
          a man's strength, though we may perhaps allow him to exult like a
          bull or lion or leopard<a id="noteref_407" name="noteref_407" href=
          "#note_407"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          his brute force, if indeed he do not lose even this and, like a
          drone, merely superintend the labours of others, himself a
          <span class="tei tei-q">“feeble warrior,”</span><a id="noteref_408"
          name="noteref_408" href="#note_408"><span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">408</span></span></a> and
          cowardly and dissolute. And if that be his character, he is lacking
          not only in true riches, but in that wealth also which men so
          highly honour and reverence and desire, on which hang the souls of
          men of all sorts, so that they undergo countless toils and labours
          for the sake of daily gain, and endure to sail the sea and to trade
          and rob and grasp at tyrannies. For they live ever acquiring but
          ever in want, though I do not say of necessary food and drink and
          clothes; for the limit of this sort of property has been clearly
          defined by nature and none can be deprived of it, neither birds nor
          fish nor wild beasts, much less prudent men. But those who are
          tortured by the desire and fatal passion for money must suffer a
          lifelong hunger,<a id="noteref_409" name="noteref_409" href=

          depart from life more miserably than those who lack daily food. For
          these, once they have filled their bellies, enjoy perfect peace and
          respite from their torment, but for those others no day is sweet
          that does not bring them gain, nor does night with her gift of
          sleep that relaxes the limbs and frees men from care<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(But it seems
          that my argument, as though it had reached some steep descent, is
          glutting itself with unsparing abuse, and is chastising the manners
          of these men beyond what is fitting, so that I must not allow it to
          travel further. But now I must demand from it an account, as far as
          is possible, of the man who is good and kingly and great-souled. In
          the first place, then, he is devout and does not neglect the
          worship of the gods, and secondly he is pious and ministers to his
          parents, both when they are alive and after their death, and he is
          friendly to his brothers, and reverences the gods who protect the
          family, while to suppliants and strangers he is mild and gentle;
          and he is anxious to gratify good citizens, and governs the masses
          with justice and for their benefit. And wealth he loves, but not
          that which is heavy with gold and silver, but that which is full of
          the true good-will of his friends,<a id="noteref_420" name=
          "noteref_420" href="#note_420"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">420</span></span></a> and
          service without flattery. Though by nature he is brave and gallant,
          he takes no pleasure in war, and detests civil discord, though when
          men do attack him, whether from some chance, or by reason of their
          own wickedness, he resists them bravely and defends himself with
          energy, and carries through his enterprises to the end, not
          desisting till he has destroyed the power of the foe and made it
          subject to himself. But after he has conquered by force of arms, he
          makes his sword cease from slaughter, because he thinks that for
          one who is no longer defending himself to go on killing and laying
          waste is to incur pollution. And being by nature fond of work, and
          great of soul, he shares in the labours of all; and claims the
          lion's share of those labours, then divides with the others the
          rewards for the risks which he has run, and is glad and rejoices,
          not because he has more gold and silver treasure than other men,
          and palaces adorned with costly furniture, but because he is able
          to do good to many, and to bestow on all men whatever they may
          chance to lack. This is what he who is truly a king claims for
          himself. And since he loves both the city and the soldiers,<a id=
          "noteref_421" name="noteref_421" href="#note_421"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">421</span></span></a> he
          cares for the citizens as a shepherd for his flock, planning how
          their young may flourish and thrive, eating their full of abundant
          and undisturbed pasture; and his soldiers he oversees and keeps
          together, training them in courage, strength and mercy, like
          well-bred dogs, noble guardians of the flock,<a id="noteref_422"
          name="noteref_422" href="#note_422"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">422</span></span></a>
          regarding them both as the partners of his exploits and the
          protectors of the masses, and not as spoilers and pillagers of the
          flock, like wolves and mongrel dogs which, forgetting their own
          nature and nurture, turn out to be marauders instead of preservers
          and defenders. Yet on the other hand, he will not suffer them to be
          sluggish, slothful and unwarlike, lest the guardians should
          themselves need others to watch them, nor disobedient to their
          officers, because he knows that obedience above all else, and
          sometimes alone, is the saving discipline in war. And he will train
          them to be hardy and not afraid of any labour, and never indolent,
          for he knows that there is not much use in a guardian who shirks
          his task and cannot hold out or endure fatigue. And not only by
          exhorting, or by his readiness to praise the deserving or by
          rewarding and punishing severely and inexorably, does he win them
          over to this and coerce them; but far rather does he show that he
          is himself what he would have them be, since he refrains from all
          pleasure, and as for money desires it not at all, much or little,
          nor robs his subjects of it; and since he abhors indolence he
          allows little time for sleep, For in truth no one who is asleep is
          good for anything,<a id="noteref_423" name="noteref_423" href=
          "#note_423"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">423</span></span></a> nor
          if, when awake he resembles those who are asleep. And he will, I
          think, succeed in keeping them wonderfully obedient to himself and
          to their officers, since he himself will be seen to obey the wisest
          laws and to live in accordance with right precepts, and in short to
          be under the guidance of that part of the soul which is naturally
          kingly and worthy to take the lead, and not of the emotional or
          undisciplined part. For how could one better persuade men to endure
          and undergo fatigue, not only in a campaign and under arms, but
          also in all those exercises that have been invented in times of
          peace to give men practice for conflicts abroad, than by being
          clearly seen to be oneself strong as adamant? For in truth the most
          agreeable sight for a soldier, when he is fighting hard, is a
          prudent commander who takes an active part in the work in hand,
          himself zealous while exhorting his men, who is cheerful and calm
          in what seems to be a dangerous situation, but on occasion stern
          and severe whenever they are over confident. For in the matter of
          caution or boldness the subordinate naturally imitates his leader.
          And he must plan as well, no less than for what I have mentioned,
          that they may have abundant provisions and run short of none of the
          necessaries of life. For often the most loyal guardians and
          protectors of the flock are driven by want to become fierce towards
          the shepherds, and when they see them from afar they bark at them
          and do not even spare the sheep.<a id="noteref_424" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(Such then is
          the good king at the head of his legions, but to his city he is a
          saviour and protector, not only when he is warding off dangers from
          without or repelling barbarian neighbours or invading them; but
          also by putting down civil discord, vicious morals, luxury and
          profligacy, he will procure relief from the greatest evils. And by
          excluding insolence, lawlessness, injustice and greed for boundless
          wealth, he will not permit the feuds that arise from these causes
          and the dissensions that end in disaster to show even the first
          sign of growth, and if they do arise he will abolish them as
          quickly as possible and expel them from his city. And no one who
          transgresses and violates the law will escape his notice, no more
          than would an enemy in the act of scaling his defences. But though
          he is a good guardian of the laws, he will be still better at
          framing them, if ever occasion and chance call on him to do so. And
          no device can persuade one of his character to add to the statutes
          a false and spurious and bastard law, any more than he would
          introduce among his own sons a servile and vulgar strain. For he
          cares for justice and the right, and neither parents nor kinsfolk
          nor friends can persuade him to do them a favour and betray the
          cause of justice. For he looks upon his fatherland as the common
          hearth and mother of all, older and more reverend than his parents,
          and more precious than brothers or friends or comrades; and to
          defraud or do violence to her laws he regards as a greater impiety
          than sacrilegious robbery of the money that belongs to the gods.
          For law is the child of justice, the sacred and truly divine
          adjunct of the most mighty god, and never will the man who is wise
          make light of it or set it at naught. But since all that he does
          will have justice in view, he will be eager to honour the good, and
          the vicious he will, like a good physician, make every effort to
          cure.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(But there are
          two kinds of error, for in one type of sinner may dimly be
          discerned a hope of improvement, nor do they wholly reject a cure,
          while the vices of others are incurable. And for the latter the
          laws have contrived the penalty of death as a release from evil,
          and this not only for the benefit of the criminal, but quite as
          much in the interest of others. Accordingly there must needs be two
          kinds of trials. For when men are not incurable the king will hold
          it to be his duty to investigate and to cure. But with the others
          he will firmly refuse to interfere, and will never willingly have
          anything to do with a trial when death is the penalty that has been
          ordained by the laws for the guilty. However, in making laws for
          such offences, he will do away with violence and harshness and
          cruelty of punishment, and will elect by lot, to judge them, a
          court of staid and sober men who throughout their lives have
          admitted the most rigid scrutiny of their own virtue, men who will
          not rashly, or led by some wholly irrational impulse, after
          deliberating for only a small part of the day, or it may be without
          even debating, cast the black voting-tablet in the case of a
          fellow-citizen. But in his own hand no sword should lie ready to
          slay a citizen, even though he has committed the blackest crimes,
          nor should a sting lurk in his soul, considering that, as we see,
          nature has made even the queen-bee free from a sting. However it is
          not to bees that we must look for our analogy, but in my opinion to
          the king of the gods himself, whose prophet and vice-regent the
          genuine ruler ought to be. For wherever good exists wholly
          untainted by its opposite, and for the benefit of mankind in common
          and the whole universe, of this good God was and is the only
          creator. But evil he neither created nor ordered to be,<a id=
          "noteref_437" name="noteref_437" href="#note_437"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">437</span></span></a> but
          he banished it from heaven, and as it moves upon earth and has
          chosen for its abode our souls, that colony which was sent down
          from heaven, he has enjoined on his sons and descendants to judge
          and cleanse men from it. Now of these some are the friends and
          protectors of the human race, but others are inexorable judges who
          inflict on men harsh and terrible punishment for their misdeeds,
          both while they are alive and after they are set free from their
          bodies, and others again are as it were executioners and avengers
          who carry out the sentence, a different race of inferior and
          unintelligent demons. Now the king who is good and a favourite of
          the gods must imitate this example, and share his own excellence
          with many of his subjects, whom, because of his regard for them, he
          admits into this partnership; and he must entrust them with offices
          suited to the character and principles of each; military command
          for him who is brave and daring and high-spirited, but discreet as
          well, so that when he has need he may use his spirit and energy;
          and for him who is just and kind and humane and easily prone to
          pity, that office in the service of the state that relates to
          contracts, devising this means of protection for the weaker and
          more simple citizens and for the poor against the powerful,
          fraudulent and wicked and those who are so buoyed up by their
          riches that they try to violate and despise justice; but to the man
          who combines both these temperaments he must assign still greater
          honour and power in the state, and if he entrust to him the trials
          of offences for which are enacted just pains and penalties with a
          view to recompensing the injured, that would be a fair and wise
          measure. For a man of this sort, together with his colleagues, will
          give an impartial decision, and then hand over to the public
          official the carrying out of the verdict, nor will he through
          excess of anger or tender-heartedness fall short of what is
          essentially just. Now the ruler in our state will be somewhat like
          this, possessing only what is good in both those qualities, and in
          every quality that I mentioned earlier avoiding a fatal
          excess.<a id="noteref_438" name="noteref_438" href=
          "#note_438"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">438</span></span></a> And
          though he will in person oversee and direct and govern the whole,
          he will see to it that those of his officials who are in charge of
          the most important works and management and who share his councils
          for the general good, are virtuous men and as far as possible like
          himself. And he will choose them, not carelessly or at random, nor
          will he consent to be a less rigorous judge than a lapidary or one
          who tests gold plate or purple dye. For such men are not satisfied
          with one method of testing, but since they know, I suppose, that
          the wickedness and devices of those who are trying to cheat them
          are various and manifold, they try to meet all these as far as
          possible, and they oppose to them the tests derived from their art.
          So too our ruler apprehends that evil changes its face and is apt
          to deceive, and that the cruellest thing that it does is that it
          often takes men in by putting on the garb of virtue, and hoodwinks
          those who are not keen sighted enough, or who in course of time
          grow weary of the length of the investigation, and therefore he
          will rightly be on his guard against any such deception. But when
          once he has chosen them, and has about him the worthiest men, he
          will entrust to them the choice of the minor officials.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(Such is his
          policy with regard to the laws and magistrates. As for the common
          people, those who live in the towns he will not allow to be idle or
          impudent, but neither will he permit them to be without the
          necessaries of life. And the farming class who live in the country,
          ploughing and sowing to furnish food for their protectors and
          guardians, will receive in return payment in money, and the clothes
          that they need. But as for Assyrian palaces and costly and
          extravagant public services, they will have nothing to do with
          them, and will end their lives in the utmost peace as regards
          enemies at home and abroad, and will adore the cause of their good
          fortune as though he were a kindly deity, and praise God for him
          when they pray, not hypocritically or with the lips only, but
          invoking blessings on him from the bottom of their hearts. But the
          gods do not wait for their prayers, and unasked they give him
          celestial rewards, but they do not let him lack human blessings
          either; and if fate should compel him to fall into any misfortune,
          I mean one of those incurable calamities that people are always
          talking about, then the gods make him their follower and associate,
          and exalt his fame among all mankind. All this I have often heard
          from the wise, and in their account of it I have the firmest faith.
          And so I have repeated it to you, perhaps making a longer speech
          than the occasion called for, but too short in my opinion for the
          theme. And he to whom it has been given to hear such arguments and
          reflect on them, knows well that I speak the truth. But there is
          another reason for the length of my speech, less forcible, but I
          think more akin to the present argument. And perhaps you ought not
          to miss hearing this also.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(In the first
          place, then, let me remind you briefly of what I said before, when
          I broke off my discourse for the sake of this digression. What I
          said was that, when serious-minded people listen to sincere
          panegyrics, they ought not to look to those things of which fortune
          often grants a share even to the wicked, but to the character of
          the man and his virtues, which belong only to those who are good
          and by nature estimable; and, taking up my tale at that point, I
          pursued the arguments that followed, guiding myself as it were by
          the rule and measure to which one ought to adjust the eulogies of
          good men and good kings. And when one of them harmonises exactly
          and without variation with this model, he is himself happy and
          truly fortunate, and happy are those who have a share in such a
          government as his. And he who comes near to being like him is
          better and more fortunate than those who fall further short of him.
          But those who fail altogether to resemble him, or who follow an
          opposite course, are ill-fated, senseless and wicked, and cause the
          greatest disasters to themselves and others.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(And now if you
          are in any way of my opinion, it is time to proceed to those
          achievements that we have so admired. And lest any should think
          that my argument is running alone, like a horse in a race that has
          lost its competitor and for that reason wins and carries off the
          prizes, I will try to show in what way my encomium differs from
          that of clever rhetoricians. For they greatly admire the fact that
          a man is born of ancestors who had power or were kings, since they
          hold that the sons of the prosperous and fortunate are themselves
          blest. But the question that next arises they neither think of nor
          investigate, I mean how they employed their advantages throughout
          their lives. And yet, after all, this is the chief cause of that
          happiness, and of almost all external goods. Unless indeed someone
          objects to this statement that it is only by wise use of it that
          property becomes a good, and that it is harmful when the opposite
          use is made. So that it is not a great thing, as they think, to be
          descended from a king who was wealthy and <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“rich in gold,”</span> but it is truly great, while
          surpassing the virtue of one's ancestors, to behave to one's
          parents in a manner beyond reproach in all respects.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(Do you wish to
          learn whether this is true of the Emperor? I will offer you
          trustworthy evidence, and I know well that you will not convict me
          of false witness. For I shall but remind you of what you know
          already. And perhaps you understand even now what I mean, but if it
          is not yet evident you very soon will, when you call to mind that
          the Emperor's father loved him more than the others, though he was
          by no means over-indulgent to his children, for it was character
          that he favoured rather than the ties of blood; but he was, I
          suppose, won over by the Emperor's dutiful service to him, and as
          he had nothing to reproach him with, he made his affection for him
          evident. And a proof of his feeling is, first, that he chose for
          Constantius that portion of the empire which he had formerly
          thought best suited to himself, and, secondly, that when he was at
          the point of death he passed over his eldest<a id="noteref_445"
          name="noteref_445" href="#note_445"><span class=

          though they were at leisure, and summoned Constantius, who was not
          at leisure, and entrusted him with the whole government. And when
          he had become master of the whole, he behaved to his brothers at
          once so justly and with such moderation, that, while they who had
          neither been summoned nor had come of themselves quarrelled and
          fought with one another, they showed no resentment against
          Constantius, nor ever reproached him. And when their feud reached
          its fatal issue<a id="noteref_447" name="noteref_447" href=
          "#note_447"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">447</span></span></a>,
          though he might have laid claim to a greater share of empire, he
          renounced it of his own free will, because he thought that many
          nations or few called for the exercise of the same virtues, and
          also, perhaps, that the more a man has to look after and care for
          the greater are the anxieties beset him. For he does not think that
          the imperial power is a means of procuring luxury, nor that, as
          certain men who have wealth and misapply it for drink and other
          pleasures set their hearts on lavish and ever-increasing revenues,
          this ought to be an emperor's policy, nor that he ought ever to
          embark on a war except only for the benefit of his subjects. And so
          he allowed his brother<a id="noteref_448" name="noteref_448" href=
          "#note_448"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">448</span></span></a> to
          have the lion's share, and thought that if he himself possessed the
          smaller share with honour, he had the advantage in what was most
          worth having. And that it was not rather from fear of his brother's
          resources that he preferred peace, you may consider clearly proved
          by the war that broke out later. For he had recourse to arms later
          on against his brother's forces, but it was to avenge him<a id=
          "noteref_449" name="noteref_449" href="#note_449"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">449</span></span></a>. And
          here again there are perhaps some who have admired him merely for
          having won the victory. But I admire far more the fact that it was
          with justice that he undertook the war, and that he carried it
          through with great courage and skill, and, when fortune gave him a
          favourable issue, used his victory with moderation and in imperial
          fashion, and showed himself entirely worthy to overcome.)</p>

          with Alexander, Philip's son, and Achilles, son of Thetis, and
          others who were not worthless or ignoble men. But only to Socrates,
          I think, and a few others who emulated him, men who were truly
          fortunate and happy, was it given to put off the last garment that
          man discards—the love of glory.<a id="noteref_460" name=

          resentment of calumny is due to the passion for glory, and for this
          reason it is implanted most deeply in the noblest souls. For they
          resent it as their deadliest foe, and those who hurl at them
          slanderous language they hate more than men who attack them with
          the sword or plot their destruction; and they regard them as
          differing from themselves, not merely in their acquired habits, but
          in their essential nature, seeing that they love praise and honour,
          and the slanderer not only robs them of these, but also
          manufactures false accusations against them. They say that even
          Heracles and certain other heroes were swayed by these emotions.
          But for my part I do not believe this account of them, and as for
          the Emperor I have seen him repelling calumny with great
          self-restraint, which in my judgment is no slighter achievement

          standards, and bringing their general<a id="noteref_466" name=

          them, chose to share danger with him rather than success with the
          usurper. And all this took place before the battle on the banks of
          the Drave, which the earlier part of my speech described to you.
          For after that they began to feel perfect confidence, though before
          that it looked as though the usurper's cause was getting the upper
          hand, when he gained some slight advantage in the affair of the
          Emperor's scouts,<a id="noteref_467" name="noteref_467" href=
          "#note_467"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">467</span></span></a> which
          indeed made the usurper beside himself with joy and greatly
          agitated those who were incapable of grasping or estimating
          generalship. But the Emperor was unperturbed and heroic, like a
          good pilot when a tempest has suddenly burst from the clouds, and
          next moment, the god shakes the depths and the shores. Then a
          terrible and dreadful panic seizes on those who are inexperienced,
          but the pilot begins to rejoice, and is glad, because he can now
          hope for a perfect and windless calm. For it is said that Poseidon,
          when he makes the earth quake, calms the waves. And just so fortune
          deceives the foolish and deludes them about more important things
          by allowing them some small advantage, but in the wise she inspires
          unshaken confidence about more serious affairs even when she
          disconcerts them in the case of those that are less serious. This
          was what happened to the Lacedaemonians at Pylae,<a id=

          they did not despair nor fear the onset of the Mede because they
          had lost three hundred Spartans and their king<a id="noteref_469"

          the entrance into Greece. This often happened to the Romans, but
          they achieved more important successes later on. Wherefore, since
          the Emperor knew this and counted on it, he in no way wavered in
          his purpose.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(But seeing that
          my argument has, of its own accord, once reached this point and is
          describing the affection that the Emperor inspires in the common
          people, the magistrates, and the garrisons who aid him to protect
          the empire and repulse its enemies, are you willing that I should
          relate to you a signal proof of this, which happened, one may say,
          yesterday or the day before? A certain man<a id="noteref_475" name=

          had been given the command of the garrisons in Galatia—you probably
          know his name and character—left his son behind him as a hostage
          for his friendship and loyalty to the Emperor, though not at the
          Emperor's request. Then he proved to be more treacherous than
          <span class="tei tei-q">“lions who have no faithful covenants with

          the poet says, and plundered the cities of their wealth and
          distributed it among the invading barbarians, paying it down as a
          sort of ransom, though he was well able to take measures to win
          security by the sword rather than by money. But he tried to win
          them over to friendliness by means of money. And finally he took
          from the women's apartments a purple dress, and showed himself
          truly a tyrant and tragical indeed. Then the soldiers, resenting
          his treachery, would not tolerate the sight of him thus dressed up
          in women's garb,<a id="noteref_477" name="noteref_477" href=

          they set on the miserable wretch and tore him limb from limb,<a id=

          would they endure either that the crescent moon<a id="noteref_479"

          should rule over them. Now it was the affection of his garrison
          that gave the Emperor this guerdon, a wonderful recompense for his
          just and blameless rule. But you are eager to hear how he behaved
          after this. This too, however, you cannot fail to know, that he
          chose neither to be harsh towards that man's son<a id="noteref_480"
          name="noteref_480" href="#note_480"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">480</span></span></a> nor
          suspicious and formidable to his friends, but in the highest
          possible degree he was merciful and kindly to them all, though many
          desired to bring false accusations<a id="noteref_481" name=
          "noteref_481" href="#note_481"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">481</span></span></a> and
          had raised their stings to strike the innocent. But though many
          were perhaps really involved in the crimes of which they were
          suspected, he was merciful to all alike, provided they had not been
          convicted or proved to be partners in the usurper's monstrous and
          abominable schemes. And shall we not declare that the forbearance
          shown by him towards the son of one who had broken the laws and
          trampled on loyalty and sworn covenants was truly royal and
          godlike; or shall we rather approve Agamemnon, who vented his rage
          and cruelty not only on those Trojans who had accompanied Paris and
          had outraged the hearth of Menelaus, but even on those who were yet
          unborn, and whose mothers even were perhaps not yet born when Paris
          plotted the rape? Anyone therefore who thinks that cruelty and
          harshness and inhumanity ill become a king, and that mercy and
          goodness and human kindness befit one who takes no pleasure in acts
          of vengeance, but grieves at the misfortunes of his subjects,
          however they may arise, whether from their own wickedness and
          ignorance or aimed at them from without by fate, will, it is
          evident, award to the Emperor the palm of victory. For bear in mind
          that he was kinder and more just to the boy than his own father,
          and to the usurper's friends he was more loyal than he who
          acknowledged the tie of friendship. For the usurper forsook them
          all, but the Emperor saved them all. And if the usurper, knowing
          all this about the Emperor's character, since he had for a long
          time been able to observe it, was entirely confident that his son
          was safely at anchor and his friends securely also, then he did
          indeed understand him aright, but he was many times over criminal
          and base and accursed for desiring to be at enmity with such a man,
          and for hating one whom he knew to be so excellent and so
          surpassingly mild, and for plotting against him and trying to rob
          him of what it was a shame to take from him. But if, on the other
          hand, his son's safety was something that he had never hoped for,
          and the safety of his friends and kinsfolk he had thought difficult
          or impossible, and he nevertheless chose to be disloyal, this is
          yet another proof that he was wicked and infatuated and fiercer
          than a wild beast, and that the Emperor was gentle and mild and
          magnanimous, since he took pity on the youth of the helpless child,
          and was merciful to those who were not proved guilty, and ignored
          and despised the crimes of the usurper. For he who grants what not
          one of his enemies expects, because the guilt that is on their
          conscience is so great, beyond a doubt carries off the prize for
          virtue: for while he tempers justice with what is nobler and more
          merciful, in self-restraint he surpasses those who are merely
          moderate in their vengeance; and in courage he excels because he
          thinks no enemy worthy of notice; and his wisdom he displays by
          suppressing enmities and by not handing them down to his sons and
          descendants on the pretext of strict justice, or of wishing, and
          very reasonably too, to blot out the seed of the wicked like the
          seed of a pine-tree.<a id="noteref_482" name="noteref_482" href=
          "#note_482"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">482</span></span></a> For
          this is the way of those trees, and in consequence an ancient
          tale<a id="noteref_483" name="noteref_483" href=
          "#note_483"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">483</span></span></a> gave
          rise to this simile. But the good Emperor, closely imitating God,
          knows that even from rocks swarms of bees fly forth, and that sweet
          fruits grow even from the bitterest wood, pleasant figs, for
          instance, and from thorns the pomegranate, and there are other
          instances where things are produced entirely unlike the parents
          that begat them and brought them forth. Therefore he thinks that we
          ought not to destroy these before they have reached maturity, but
          to wait for time to pass, and to trust them to cast off the folly
          and madness of their fathers and become good and temperate, but

          think I have made my sincere panegyric sufficiently thorough and
          complete? Or are you anxious to hear also about the Emperor's
          powers of endurance and his august bearing, and that not only is he
          unconquerable by the enemy, but has never yet succumbed to any
          disgraceful appetite, and never coveted a fine house or a costly
          palace or a necklace of emeralds, and then robbed their owners of
          them either by violence or persuasion; and that he has never
          coveted any free-born woman or handmaid or pursued any
          dishonourable passion; and that he does not even desire an
          immoderate surfeit of the good things that the seasons produce, or
          care for ice in summer, or change his residence with the time of
          year; but is ever at hand to aid those portions of the empire that
          are in trouble, enduring both frost and extreme heat? But if you
          should bid me bring before you plain proofs of this, I shall merely
          say what is familiar to all, and I shall not lack evidence, but the
          account would be long, a monstrous speech, nor indeed have I
          leisure to cultivate the Muses to such an extent, for it is now

          the Empress Eusebia, the first wife of Constantius. After Julian's
          intractable step-brother Gallus Caesar had been murdered by the
          Emperor, he was summoned to the court at Milan, and there, awkward
          and ill at ease, cut off from his favourite studies and from the
          society of philosophers, surrounded by intriguing and unfriendly
          courtiers, and regarded with suspicion by the Emperor, Julian was
          protected, encouraged and advised by Eusebia. His praise and
          gratitude are, for once, sincere. The oration must have been
          composed either in Gaul or shortly before Julian set out thither
          after the dangerous dignity of the Caesarship had been thrust upon
          him. His sincerity has affected his style, which is simpler and
          more direct than that of the other two Panegyrics.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(What, pray,
          ought we to think of those who owe things of price and beyond
          price—I do not mean gold or silver, but simply any benefit one may
          happen to receive from one's neighbour—suppose that they neither
          try nor intend to repay that kindness, but are indolent and do not
          trouble themselves to do what they can and try to discharge the
          debt? Is it not evident that we must think them mean and base? Far
          more I think than any other crime do we hate ingratitude, and we
          blame those persons who have received benefits and are ungrateful
          to their benefactors. And the ungrateful man is not only he who
          repays a kindness with evil deeds or words, but also he who is
          silent and conceals a kindness and tries to consign it to oblivion
          and abolish gratitude. Now of such brutal and inhuman baseness as
          the repayment with evil the instances are few and easily reckoned;
          but there are many who try to conceal the appearance of having
          received benefits, though with what purpose I know not. They
          assert, however, that it is because they are trying to avoid a
          reputation for a sort of servility and for base flattery. But
          though I know well enough that what they say is all insincere,
          nevertheless I let that pass, and suppose we assume that they, as
          they think, do escape an undeserved reputation for flattery, still
          they at the same time appear to be guilty of many weaknesses and
          defects of character that are in the highest degree base and
          illiberal. For either they are too dense to perceive what no one
          should fail to perceive, or they are not dense but forgetful of
          what they ought to remember for all time. Or again, they do
          remember, and yet shirk their duty for some reason or other, being
          cowards and grudging by nature, and their hand is against every man
          without exception, seeing that not even to their benefactors do
          they consent to be gentle and amiable; and then if there be any
          opening to slander and bite, they look angry and fierce like wild
          beasts. Genuine praise they somehow or other avoid giving, as
          though it were a costly extravagance, and they censure the applause
          given to noble actions, when the only thing that they need enquire
          into is whether the eulogists respect truth and rate her higher
          than the reputation of showing their gratitude by eulogy. For this
          at any rate they cannot assert, that praise is a useless thing,
          either to those who receive it or to others besides, who, though
          they have been assigned the same rank in life as the objects of
          their praise, have fallen short of their merit in what they have
          accomplished. To the former it is not only agreeable to hear, but
          makes them zealous to aim at a still higher level of conduct, while
          the latter it stimulates both by persuasion and compulsion to
          imitate that noble conduct, because they see that none of those who
          have anticipated them have been deprived of that which alone it is
          honourable to give and receive publicly. For to give money openly,
          and to look anxiously round that as many as possible may know of
          the gift, is characteristic of a vulgar person. Nay no one would
          even stretch out his hands to receive it in the sight of all men,
          unless he had first cast off all propriety of manner and sense of
          shame. Arcesilaus indeed, when offering a gift, used to try to hide
          his identity even from the recipient.<a id="noteref_497" name=
          "noteref_497" href="#note_497"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">497</span></span></a> But
          in his case the manner of the deed always made known the doer. For
          a eulogy, however, one is ambitious to obtain as many hearers as
          possible, and even a small audience is, I think, not to be
          despised. Socrates, for instance, spoke in praise of many, as did
          Plato also and Aristotle. Xenophon, too, eulogised King Agesilaus
          and Cyrus the Persian, not only the elder Cyrus, but him whom he
          accompanied on his campaign against the Great King, nor did he hide
          away his eulogies, but put them into his history. Now I should
          think it strange indeed if we shall be eager to applaud men of high
          character, and not think fit to give our tribute of praise to a
          noble woman, believing as we do that excellence is the attribute of
          women no less than of men. Or shall we who think that such a one
          ought to be modest and wise and competent to assign to every man
          his due, and brave in danger, high-minded and generous, and that in
          a word all such qualities as these should be hers,—shall we, I say,
          then rob her of the encomium due to her good deeds, from any fear
          of the charge of appearing to flatter? But Homer was not ashamed to
          praise Penelope and the consort of Alcinous<a id="noteref_498"
          name="noteref_498" href="#note_498"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">498</span></span></a> and
          other women of exceptional goodness, or even those whose claim to
          virtue was slight. Nay nor did Penelope fail to obtain her share of
          praise for this very thing. But besides these reasons for praise,
          shall we consent to accept kind treatment from a woman no less than
          from a man, and to obtain some boon whether small or great, and
          then hesitate to pay the thanks due therefor? But perhaps people
          will say that the very act of making a request to a woman is
          despicable and unworthy of an honourable and high-spirited man, and
          that even the wise Odysseus was spiritless and cowardly because he
          was a suppliant to the king's daughter<a id="noteref_499" name=
          "noteref_499" href="#note_499"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">499</span></span></a> as
          she played with her maiden companions by the banks of the river.
          Perhaps they will not spare even Athene the daughter of Zeus, of
          whom Homer says<a id="noteref_500" name="noteref_500" href=
          "#note_500"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          she put on the likeness of a fair and noble maiden and guided him
          along the road that led to the palace, and was his adviser and
          instructed him what he must do and say when he had entered within;
          and that, like some orator perfect in the art of rhetoric, she sang
          an encomium of the queen, and for a prelude told the tale of her
          lineage from of old. Homer's verses about this are as follows:)</p>

          have much that is highly honourable to say about her native
          land,<a id="noteref_505" name="noteref_505" href=

          think it well to omit part, because of its antiquity. For it seems
          to be not far removed from myth. For instance, the sort of story
          that is told about the Muses, that they actually came from
          Pieria<a id="noteref_506" name="noteref_506" href=
          "#note_506"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">506</span></span></a> and
          that it was not from Helicon that they came to Olympus, when
          summoned to their father's side. This then, and all else of the
          same sort, since it is better suited to a fable than to my
          narrative, must be omitted. But perhaps it is not out of the way
          nor alien from my present theme to tell some of the facts that are
          not familiar to all. They say<a id="noteref_507" name="noteref_507"
          href="#note_507"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">507</span></span></a> that
          Macedonia was colonised by the descendants of Heracles, the sons of
          Temenus, who had been awarded Argos as their portion, then
          quarrelled, and to make an end of their strife and jealousy led out
          a colony. Then they seized Macedonia, and leaving a prosperous
          family behind them, they succeeded to the throne, king after king,
          as though the privilege were an inheritance. Now to praise all
          these would be neither truthful, nor in my opinion easy. But though
          many of them were brave men and left behind them very glorious
          monuments of the Hellenic character, Philip and his son surpassed
          in valour all who of old ruled over Macedonia and Thrace, yes and I
          should say all who governed the Lydians as well, or the Medes and
          Persians and Assyrians, except only the son of Cambyses,<a id=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">508</span></span></a> who
          transferred the sovereignty from the Medes to the Persians. For
          Philip was the first to try to increase the power of the
          Macedonians, and when he had subdued the greater part of Europe, he
          made the sea his frontier limit on the east and south, and on the
          north I think the Danube, and on the west the people of
          Oricus,<a id="noteref_509" name="noteref_509" href=
          "#note_509"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">509</span></span></a> And
          after him, his son, who was bred up at the feet of the wise
          Stagyrite,<a id="noteref_510" name="noteref_510" href=

          far excelled all the rest in greatness of soul, and besides,
          surpassed his own father in generalship and courage and the other
          virtues, that he thought that life for him was not worth living
          unless he could subdue all men and all nations. And so he traversed
          the whole of Asia, conquering as he went, and he was the first of
          men<a id="noteref_511" name="noteref_511" href=

          adore the rising sun; but as he was setting out for Europe in order
          to gain control of the remainder and so become master of the whole
          earth and sea, he paid the debt of nature in Babylon. Then
          Macedonians became the rulers of all the cities and nations that
          they had acquired under his leadership. And now is it still
          necessary to show by stronger proofs that Macedonia was famous and
          great of old? And the most important place in Macedonia is that
          city which they restored, after, I think, the fall of the
          Thessalians, and which is called after their victory over
          them.<a id="noteref_512" name="noteref_512" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(And of her
          noble birth why should I take any further trouble to seek for
          clearer or more manifest proof than this? I mean that she is the
          daughter of a man who was considered worthy to hold the office that
          gives its name to the year,<a id="noteref_516" name="noteref_516"
          href="#note_516"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">516</span></span></a> an
          office that in the past was powerful and actually called royal, but
          lost that title because of those who abused their power. But now
          that in these days its power has waned, since the government has
          changed to a monarchy, the bare honour, though robbed of all the
          rest, is held to counterbalance all power, and for private citizens
          is set up as a sort of prize and a reward of virtue, or loyalty, or
          of some favour done to the ruler of the empire, or for some
          brilliant exploit, while for the emperors, it is added to the
          advantages they already possess as the crowning glory and
          adornment. For all the other titles and functions that still retain
          some feeble and shadowy resemblance to the ancient constitution
          they either altogether despised and rejected, because of their
          absolute power, or they attached them to themselves and enjoy the
          titles for life. But this office alone, I think, they from the
          first did not despise, and it still gratifies them when they obtain
          it for the year. Indeed there is no private citizen or emperor, nor
          has ever been, who did not think it an enviable distinction to be
          entitled consul. And if there be anyone who thinks that, because he
          I spoke of was the first of his line to win that title and to lay
          the foundations of distinction for his family, he is therefore
          inferior to the others, he fails to understand that he is deceived
          exceedingly. For it is, in my opinion, altogether nobler and more
          honourable to lay the foundations of such great distinction for
          one's descendants than to receive it from one's ancestors. For
          indeed it is a nobler thing to be the founder of a mighty city than
          a mere citizen and to receive any good thing is altogether less
          dignified than to give. Indeed it is evident that sons receive from
          their fathers, and citizens from their cities, a start, as it were,
          on the path of glory. But he who by his own effort pays back to his
          ancestors and his native land that honour on a higher scale, and
          makes his country show more brilliant and more distinguished, and
          his ancestors more illustrious, clearly yields the prize to no man
          on the score of native nobility. Nor is there any man who can claim
          to be superior to him I speak of. For the good must needs be born
          of good parents. But when the son of illustrious parents himself
          becomes more illustrious, and fortune blows the same way as his
          merit, he causes no one to feel doubt, if he lays claim, as is
          reasonable, to be of native nobility.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(Now Eusebia,
          the subject of my speech, was the daughter of a consul, and is the
          consort of an Emperor who is brave, temperate, wise, just,
          virtuous, mild and high-souled, who, when he acquired the throne
          that had belonged to his ancestors, and had won it back from him
          who had usurped it by violence, and desired to wed that he might
          beget sons to inherit his honour and power, deemed this lady worthy
          of his alliance, when he had already become master of almost the
          whole world. And indeed why should one search for stronger evidence
          than this? Evidence, I mean, not only of her native nobility, but
          of all those combined gifts which she who is united to so great an
          Emperor ought to bring with her from her home as a dowry, wit and
          wisdom, a body in the flower of youth, and beauty so conspicuous as
          to throw into the shade all other maidens beside, even as, I
          believe, the radiant stars about the moon at the full are outshone
          and hide their shape.<a id="noteref_518" name="noteref_518" href=

          no single one of these endowments is thought to suffice for an
          alliance with an Emperor, but all together, as though some god were
          fashioning for a virtuous Emperor a fair and modest bride, were
          united in her single person and, attracting not his eyes alone,
          brought from afar that bridegroom blest of heaven. For beauty
          alone, if it lacks the support of birth and the other advantages I
          have mentioned, is not enough to induce even a licentious man, a
          mere citizen, to kindle the marriage torch, though both combined
          have brought about many a match, but when they occur without
          sweetness and charm of character they are seen to be far from

          reason to say that the Emperor in his prudence understood this
          clearly, and that it was only after long deliberation that he chose
          this marriage, partly making enquiries about all that was needful
          to learn about her by hearsay, but judging also from her mother of
          the daughter's noble disposition. Of that mother why should I take
          time to say more, as though I had not to recite a special encomium
          on her who is the theme of my speech? But so much perhaps I may say
          briefly and you may hear without weariness, that her family is
          entirely Greek, yes Greek of the purest stock, and her native city
          was the metropolis of Macedonia, and she was more self-controlled
          than Evadne<a id="noteref_522" name="noteref_522" href=

          Thessaly. For these two, when they had lost their husbands, who
          were young, handsome and still newly-wed, whether by the constraint
          of some envious powers, or because the threads of the fates were so
          woven, threw away their lives for love. But the mother of the
          Empress, when his fate had come upon her wedded lord, devoted
          herself to her children, and won a great reputation for prudence,
          so great indeed, that whereas Penelope, while her husband was still
          on his travels and wanderings, was beset by those young suitors who
          came to woo her from Ithaca and Samos and Dulichium, that lady no
          man however fair and tall or powerful and wealthy ever ventured to
          approach with any such proposals. And her daughter the Emperor
          deemed worthy to live by his side, and after setting up the
          trophies of his victories, he celebrated the marriage with great
          splendour, feasting nations and cities and peoples.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(But should any
          haply desire to hear of such things as how the bride was bidden to
          come from Macedonia with her mother, and what was the manner of the
          cavalcade, of the chariots and horses and carriages of all sorts,
          decorated with gold and silver and copper of the finest
          workmanship, let me tell him that it is extremely childish of him
          to wish to hear such things. It is like the case of some player on
          the cithara who is an accomplished artist—let us say if you please

          whom the story goes that he enjoyed a divine escort and found that
          the dolphin cared more for music than did his fellow-voyagers, and
          was thus conveyed safely to the Laconian promontory.<a id=
          "noteref_530" name="noteref_530" href="#note_530"><span class=

          though he did indeed charm those miserable sailors by his skilful
          performance, yet they despised his art and paid no heed to his
          music. Now, as I was going to say, if some one were to choose the
          best of those two musicians, and were to clothe him in the raiment
          suited to his art, and were then to bring him into a theatre full
          of men, women and children of all sorts, varying in temperament and
          age and habits besides, do you not suppose that the children and
          those of the men and women who had childish tastes would gaze at
          his dress and his lyre, and be marvellously smitten with his
          appearance, while the more ignorant of the men, and the whole crowd
          of women, except a very few, would judge his playing simply by the
          criterion of pleasure or the reverse; whereas a musical man who
          understood the rules of the art would not endure that the melodies
          should be wrongly mixed for the sake of giving pleasure, but would
          resent it if the player did not preserve the modes of the music and
          did not use the harmonies properly, and conformably to the laws of
          genuine and inspired music? But if he saw that he was faithful to
          the principles of his art and produced in the audience a pleasure
          that was not spurious but pure and uncontaminated, he would go home
          praising the musician, and filled with admiration because his
          performance in the theatre was artistic and did the Muses no wrong.
          But such a man thinks that anyone who praises the purple raiment
          and the lyre is foolish and out of his mind, while, if he goes on
          to give full details about such outward things, adorning them with
          an agreeable style and smoothing away all that is worthless and
          vulgar in the tale, then the critic thinks him more ridiculous than
          those who try to carve cherry-stones,<a id="noteref_531" name=

          thus sought to rival the art of Pheidias. And so neither will I, if
          I can help it, lay myself open to this charge by reciting the long
          list of costly robes and gifts of all kinds and necklaces and
          garlands that were sent by the Emperor, nor how the folk in each
          place came to meet her with welcome and rejoicing, nor all the
          glorious and auspicious incidents that occurred on that journey,
          and were reported. But when she entered the palace and was honoured
          with her imperial title, what was the first thing she did and then
          the second and the third and the many actions that followed? For
          however much I might wish to tell of them and to compose lengthy
          volumes about them, I think that, for the majority, those of her
          deeds will be sufficient that more conspicuously witnessed to her
          wisdom and clemency and modesty and benevolence and goodness and
          generosity and her other virtues, than does now the present account
          of her, which tries to enlighten and instruct those who have long
          known it all from personal experience. For it would not be at all
          proper, merely because the task has proved to be difficult or
          rather impossible, to keep silence about the whole, but one should
          rather try, as far as one can, to tell about those deeds, and to
          bring forward as a proof of her wisdom and of all her other virtues
          the fact that she made her husband regard her as it is fitting that
          he should regard a beautiful and noble wife.)</p>

          bunches of excellent grapes, laden with clusters. And at the
          Phaeacian court there were the same things, except that they were
          more costly, seeing that, as I suppose, they were made by art, and
          hence had less charm and seemed less lovely than those that were of
          natural growth. Now to all that luxury and wealth, and moreover to
          the peace and quiet that surrounded those islands, who do you think
          would not have succumbed, especially one who had endured so great
          toils and dangers and expected that he would have to suffer still
          more terrible hardships, partly by sea and partly in his own house,
          since he had to fight all alone against a hundred youths in their
          prime, a thing which had never happened to him even in the land of
          Troy? Now if someone in jest were to question Odysseus somewhat in
          this fashion: <span class="tei tei-q">“Why, O most wise orator or
          general, or whatever one must call you, did you endure so many
          toils, when you might have been prosperous and happy and perhaps
          even immortal, if one may at all believe the promises of Calypso?
          But you chose the worse instead of the better, and imposed on
          yourself all those hardships<a id="noteref_538" name="noteref_538"

          refused to remain even in Scheria, though you might surely have
          rested there from your wandering and been delivered from your
          perils; but behold you resolved to carry on the war in your own
          house and to perform feats of valour and to accomplish a second
          journey, not less toilsome, as seemed likely, nor easier than the
          first!”</span> What answer then do you think he would give to this?
          Would he not answer that he longed always to be with Penelope, and
          that those contests and campaigns he purposed to take back to her
          as a pleasant tale to tell? For this reason, then, he makes his
          mother exhort him to remember everything, all the sights he saw and
          all the things he heard, and then she says:)</p>

          forgot nothing, and no sooner had he come home and vanquished, as
          was just, the youths who caroused in the palace, than he related
          all to her without pause, all that he had achieved and endured, and
          all else that, obeying the oracles, he purposed still to
          accomplish.<a id="noteref_547" name="noteref_547" href=

          from her he kept nothing secret, but chose that she should be the
          partner of his counsels and should help him to plan and contrive
          what he must do. And do you think this a trifling tribute to
          Penelope, or is there not now found to be yet another woman whose
          virtue surpasses hers, and who, as the consort of a brave,
          magnanimous and prudent Emperor, has won as great affection from
          her husband, since she has mingled with the tenderness that is
          inspired by love that other which good and noble souls derive from
          their own virtue, whence it flows like a sacred fount? For there
          are two jars,<a id="noteref_548" name="noteref_548" href=
          "#note_548"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">548</span></span></a> so to
          speak, of these two kinds of human affection, and Eusebia drew in
          equal measure from both, and so has come to be the partner of her
          husband's counsels, and though the Emperor is by nature merciful,
          good and wise, she encourages him to follow yet more becomingly his
          natural bent, and ever turns justice to mercy. So that no one could
          ever cite a case in which this Empress, whether with justice, as
          might happen, or unjustly, has ever been the cause of punishment or
          chastisement either great or small. Now we are told that at Athens,
          in the days when they employed their ancestral customs and lived in
          obedience to their own laws, as the inhabitants of a great and
          humane city, whenever the votes of the jurymen were cast evenly for
          defendant and plaintiff, the vote of Athene<a id="noteref_549"
          name="noteref_549" href="#note_549"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">549</span></span></a> was
          awarded to him who would have incurred the penalty, and thus both
          were acquitted of guilt, he who had brought the accusation, of the
          reputation of sycophant, and the defendant, naturally, of the guilt
          of the crime. Now this humane and gracious custom is kept up in the
          suits which the Emperor judges, but Eusebia's mercy goes further.
          For whenever the defendant comes near to obtaining an equal number
          of votes, she persuades the Emperor, adding her request and
          entreaty on his behalf, to acquit the man entirely of the charge.
          And of free will with willing heart he grants the boon, and does
          not give it as Homer says Zeus, constrained by his wife, agreed as
          to what he should concede to her <span class="tei tei-q">“of free
          will but with soul unwilling.”</span><a id="noteref_550" name=
          "noteref_550" href="#note_550"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">550</span></span></a> And
          perhaps it is not strange that he should concede this pardon
          reluctantly and under protest in the case of the violent and
          depraved. But not even when men richly deserve to suffer and be
          punished ought they to be utterly ruined. Now since the Empress
          recognises this, she has never bidden him inflict any injury of any
          kind, or any punishment or chastisement even on a single household
          of the citizens, much less on a whole kingdom or city. And I might
          add, with the utmost confidence that I am speaking the absolute
          truth, that in the case of no man or woman is it possible to charge
          her with any misfortune that has happened, but all the benefits
          that she confers and has conferred, and on whom, I would gladly
          recount in as many cases as possible, and report them one by one,
          how for instance this man, thanks to her, enjoys his ancestral
          estate, and that man has been saved from punishment, though he was
          guilty in the eyes of the law, how a third escaped a malicious
          prosecution, though he came within an ace of the danger, how
          countless persons have received honour and office at her hands. And
          on this subject there is no one of them all who will assert that I
          speak falsely, even though I should not give a list of those
          persons by name. But this I hesitate to do, lest I should seem to
          some to be reproaching them with their sufferings, and to be
          composing not so much an encomium of her good deeds as a catalogue
          of the misfortunes of others. And yet, not to cite any of these
          acts of hers, and to bring no proof of them before the public seems
          perhaps to imply that they are lacking, and brings discredit on my
          encomium. Accordingly, to deprecate that charge, I shall relate so
          much as it is not invidious for me to speak or for her to
          hear.)</p>

          forthwith showered honours on all her family and kinsfolk,
          appointing to more important functions those who had already been
          tested and were of mature age, and making them seem fortunate and
          enviable, and she won for them the Emperor's friendship and laid
          the foundation of their present prosperity. And if anyone thinks,
          what is in fact true, that on their own account they are worthy of
          honour, he will applaud her all the more. For it is evident that it
          was their merit, far more than the ties of kinship, that she
          rewarded; and one could hardly pay her a higher compliment than
          that. Such then was her treatment of these. And to all who, since
          they were still obscure on account of their youth, needed
          recognition of any sort, she awarded lesser honours. In fact she
          left nothing undone to help one and all. And not only on her
          kinsfolk has she conferred such benefits, but whenever she learned
          that ties of friendship used to exist with her ancestors, she has
          not allowed it to be unprofitable to those who owned such ties, but
          she honours them, I understand, no less than her own kinsfolk, and
          to all whom she regards as her father's friends she dispensed
          wonderful rewards for their friendship.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(But since I see
          that my account is in need of proofs, just as in a law-court, I
          will offer myself to bear witness on its behalf to these actions
          and to applaud them. But lest you should mistrust my evidence and
          cause a disturbance before you have heard what I have to say, I
          swear that I will tell you no falsehood or fiction; although you
          would have believed, even without an oath, that I am saying all
          this without intent to flatter. For I already possess, by the grace
          of God and the Emperor, and because the Empress too was zealous in
          my behalf, all those blessings to gain which a flatterer would
          leave nothing unsaid, so that, if I were speaking before obtaining
          these, perhaps I should have to dread that unjust suspicion. But as
          it is, since this is the state of my fortunes, I will recall her
          conduct to me, and at the same time give you a proof of my own
          right-mindedness and truthful evidence of her good deeds. I have
          heard that Darius, while he was still in the bodyguard of the
          Persian monarch,<a id="noteref_555" name="noteref_555" href=
          "#note_555"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">555</span></span></a> met,
          in Egypt, a Samian stranger<a id="noteref_556" name="noteref_556"
          href="#note_556"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">556</span></span></a> who
          was an exile from his own country, and accepted from him the gift
          of a scarlet cloak to which Darius had taken a great fancy, and
          that later on, in the days when, I understand, he had become the
          master of all Asia, he gave him in return the tyranny of Samos. And
          now suppose that I acknowledge that, though I received many
          kindnesses at Eusebia's hands, at a time when I was still permitted
          to live in peaceful obscurity, and many also, by her intercession,
          from our noble and magnanimous Emperor, I must needs fall short of
          making an equal return; for as I know, she possesses everything
          already, as the gift of him who was so generous to myself; yet
          since I desire that the memory of her good deeds should be
          immortal, and since I am relating them to you, perhaps I shall not
          be thought less mindful of my debt than the Persian, seeing that in
          forming a judgment it is to the intention that one must look, and
          not to an instance in which fortune granted a man the power to
          repay his obligation many times over.)</p>

          say that I have been so kindly treated, and in return for what I
          acknowledge that I am her debtor for all time, that is what you are
          eager to hear. Nor shall I conceal the facts. The Emperor was kind
          to me almost from my infancy, and he surpassed all generosity, for
          he snatched me from dangers so great that not even <span class=

          easily have escaped them, unless he obtained some means of safety
          sent by heaven and not attainable by human means, and after my
          house had been seized by one of those in power, as though there
          were none to defend it, he recovered it for me, as was just, and
          made it wealthy once more. And I could tell you of still other
          kindnesses on his part towards myself, that deserve all gratitude,
          in return for which I ever showed myself loyal and faithful to him;
          but nevertheless of late I perceived that, I know not why, he was
          somewhat harsh towards me. Now the Empress no sooner heard a bare
          mention, not of any actual wrong-doing but of mere idle suspicion,
          than she deigned to investigate it, and before doing so would not
          admit or listen to any falsehood or unjust slander, but persisted
          in her request until she brought me into the Emperor's presence and
          procured me speech with him. And she rejoiced when I was acquitted
          of every unjust charge, and when I wished to return home, she first
          persuaded the Emperor to give his permission, and then furnished me
          with a safe escort. Then when some deity, the one I think who
          devised my former troubles, or perhaps some unfriendly chance, cut
          short this journey, she sent me to visit Greece, having asked this
          favour on my behalf from the Emperor, when I had already left the
          country. This was because she had learned that I delighted in
          literature, and she knew that that place is the home of culture.
          Then indeed I prayed first, as is meet, for the Emperor, and next
          for Eusebia, that God would grant them many blessings, because when
          I longed and desired to behold my true fatherland, they made it
          possible. For we who dwell in Thrace and Ionia are the sons of
          Hellas, and all of us who are not devoid of feeling long to greet
          our ancestors and to embrace the very soil of Hellas. So this had
          long been, as was natural, my dearest wish, and I desired it more
          than to possess treasures of gold and silver. For I consider that
          intercourse with distinguished men, when weighed in the balance
          with any amount whatever of gold, drags down the beam, and does not
          permit a prudent judge even to hesitate over a slight turn of the
          scale.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(Now, as regards
          learning and philosophy, the condition of Greece in our day reminds
          one somewhat of the tales and traditions of the Egyptians. For the
          Egyptians say that the Nile in their country is not only the
          saviour and benefactor of the land, but also wards off destruction
          by fire, when the sun, throughout long periods, in conjunction or
          combination with fiery constellations, fills the atmosphere with
          heat and scorches everything. For it has not power enough, so they
          say, to evaporate or exhaust the fountains of the Nile. And so too
          neither from the Greeks has philosophy altogether departed, nor has
          she forsaken Athens or Sparta or Corinth. And, as regards these
          fountains, Argos can by no means be called <span class=

          famous of old. Yet Sicyon, not Corinth, possesses Peirene itself.
          And Athens has many such streams, pure and springing from the soil,
          and many flow into the city from abroad, but no less precious than
          those that are native. And her people love and cherish them and
          desire to be rich in that which alone makes wealth enviable.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(But as for me,
          what has come over me? And what speech do I intend to achieve if
          not a panegyric of my beloved Hellas, of which one cannot make
          mention without admiring everything? But perhaps someone,
          remembering what I said earlier, will say that this is not what I
          intended to discuss when I began, and that, just as Corybants when
          excited by the flute dance and leap without method, so I, spurred
          on by the mention of my beloved city, am chanting the praises of
          that country and her people. To him I must make excuse somewhat as
          follows: Good sir, you who are the guide to an art that is
          genuinely noble, that is a wise notion of yours, for you do not
          permit or grant one to let go even for a moment the theme of a
          panegyric, seeing that you yourself maintain your theme with skill.
          Yet in my case, since there has come over me this impulse of
          affection which you say is to blame for the lack of order in my
          arguments, you really urge me, I think, not to be too much afraid
          of it or to take precautions against criticism. For I am not
          embarking on irrelevant themes if I wish to show how great were the
          blessings that Eusebia procured for me because she honoured the
          name of philosophy. And yet the name of philosopher which has been,
          I know not why, applied to myself, is really in my case nothing but
          a name and lacks reality, for though I love the reality and am
          terribly enamoured of the thing itself, yet for some reason I have
          fallen short of it. But Eusebia honoured even the name. For no
          other reason can I discover, nor learn from anyone else, why she
          became so zealous an ally of mine, and an averter of evil and my
          preserver, and took such trouble and pains in order that I might
          retain unaltered and unaffected our noble Emperor's good-will; and
          I have never been convicted of thinking that there is any greater
          blessing in this world than that good-will, since all the gold
          above the earth or beneath the earth is not worth so much, nor all
          the mass of silver that is now beneath the sun's rays or may be
          added thereto,<a id="noteref_564" name="noteref_564" href=

          though the loftiest mountains, let us suppose, stones and trees and
          all were to change to that substance, nor the greatest sovereignty
          there is, nor anything else in the whole world. And I do indeed owe
          it to her that these blessings are mine, so many and greater than
          anyone could have hoped for, for in truth I did not ask for much,
          nor did I nourish myself with any such hopes.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(But genuine
          kindness one cannot obtain in exchange for money, nor could anyone
          purchase it by such means, but it exists only when men of noble
          character work in harmony with a sort of divine and higher
          providence. And this the Emperor bestowed on me even as a child,
          and when it had almost vanished it was restored again to me because
          the Empress defended me and warded off those false and monstrous
          suspicions. And when, using the evidence of my life as plain proof,
          she had completely cleared me of them, and I obeyed once more the
          Emperor's summons from Greece, did she ever forsake me, as though,
          now that all enmity and suspicion had been removed, I no longer
          needed much assistance? Would my conduct be pious if I kept silence
          and concealed actions so manifest and so honourable? For when a
          good opinion of me was established in the Emperor's mind, she
          rejoiced exceedingly, and echoed him harmoniously, bidding me take
          courage and neither refuse out of awe to accept the greatness<a id=
          "noteref_571" name="noteref_571" href="#note_571"><span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">571</span></span></a> of
          what was offered to me, nor, by employing a boorish and arrogant
          frankness, unworthily slight the urgent request of him who had
          shown me such favour. And so I obeyed, though it was by no means
          agreeable to me to support this burden, and besides I knew well
          that to refuse was altogether impracticable. For when those who
          have the power to exact by force what they wish condescend to
          entreat, naturally they put one out of countenance and there is
          nothing left but to obey. Now when I consented, I had to change my
          mode of dress, and my attendants, and my habitual pursuits, and my
          very house and way of life for what seemed full of pomp and
          ceremony to one whose past had naturally been so modest and humble,
          and my mind was confused by the strangeness, though it was
          certainly not dazzled by the magnitude of the favours that were now
          mine. For in my ignorance I hardly regarded them as great
          blessings, but rather as powers of the greatest benefit, certainly,
          to those who use them aright, but, when mistakes are made in their
          use, as being harmful to many houses and cities and the cause of
          countless disasters. So I felt like a man who is altogether
          unskilled in driving a chariot,<a id="noteref_572" name=

          is not at all inclined to acquire the art, and then is compelled to
          manage a car that belongs to a noble and talented charioteer, one
          who keeps many pairs and many four-in-hands too, let us suppose,
          and has mounted behind them all, and because of his natural talent
          and uncommon strength has a strong grip on the reins of all of
          them, even though he is mounted on one chariot; yet he does not
          always remain on it, but often moves to this side or that and
          changes from car to car, whenever he perceives that his horses are
          distressed or are getting out of hand; and among these chariots he
          has a team of four that become restive from ignorance and high
          spirit, and are oppressed by continuous hard work, but none the
          less are mindful of that high spirit, and ever grow more unruly and
          are irritated by their distress, so that they grow more restive and
          disobedient and pull against the driver and refuse to go in a
          certain direction, and unless they see the charioteer himself or at
          least some man wearing the dress of a charioteer, end by becoming
          violent, so unreasoning are they by nature. But when the charioteer
          encourages some unskilful man, and sets him over them, and allows
          him to wear the same dress as his own, and invests him with the
          outward seeming of a splendid and skilful charioteer, then if he be
          altogether foolish and witless, he rejoices and is glad and is
          buoyed up and exalted by those robes, as though by wings, but, if
          he has even a small share of common sense and prudent
          understanding, he is very much alarmed)</p>

          myself in the night season, and in the daytime pondering it with
          myself, and I was continually thoughtful and gloomy. Then the noble
          and truly godlike Emperor lessened my torment in every way, and
          showed me honour and favour both in deed and word. And at last he
          bade me address myself to the Empress, inspiring me with courage
          and giving me a very generous indication that I might trust her
          completely. Now when first I came into her presence it seemed to me
          as though I beheld a statue of Modesty set up in some temple. Then
          reverence filled my soul, and my eyes were fixed upon the
          ground<a id="noteref_575" name="noteref_575" href=

          some considerable time, till she bade me take courage. Then she
          said: <span class="tei tei-q">“Certain favours you have already
          received from us and yet others you shall receive, if God will, if
          only you prove to be loyal and honest towards us.”</span> This was
          almost as much as I heard. For she herself did not say more, and
          that though she knew how to utter speeches not a whit inferior to
          those of the most gifted orators. And I, when I had departed from
          this interview, felt the deepest admiration and awe, and was
          clearly convinced that it was Modesty herself I had heard speaking.
          So gentle and comforting was her utterance, and it is ever firmly
          settled in my ears.)</p>

          Nevertheless one of those gifts of hers it would perhaps not be
          ungraceful to mention to you, for it was one with which I was
          myself especially delighted. For she gave me the best books on
          philosophy and history, and many of the orators and poets, since I
          had brought hardly any with me from home, deluding myself with the
          hope and longing to return home again, and gave them in such
          numbers, and all at once, that even my desire for them was
          satisfied, though I am altogether insatiable of converse with
          literature; and, so far as books went, she made Galatia<a id=
          "noteref_582" name="noteref_582" href="#note_582"><span class=

          the country of the Celts resemble a Greek temple of the Muses. And
          to these gifts I applied myself incessantly whenever I had leisure,
          so that I can never be unmindful of the gracious giver. Yes, even
          when I take the field one thing above all else goes with me as a
          necessary provision for the campaign, some one narrative of a
          campaign composed long ago by an eye-witness. For many of those
          records of the experience of men of old, written as they are with
          the greatest skill, furnish to those who, by reason of their youth,
          have missed seeing such a spectacle, a clear and brilliant picture
          of those ancient exploits, and by this means many a tiro has
          acquired a more mature understanding and judgment than belongs to
          very many older men; and that advantage which people think old age
          alone can give to mankind, I mean experience (for experience it is
          that enables an old man <span class="tei tei-q">“to talk more
          wisely than the young”</span><a id="noteref_583" name="noteref_583"

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">583</span></span></a>),
          even this the study of history can give to the young if only they
          are diligent. Moreover, in my opinion, there is in such books a
          means of liberal education for the character, supposing that one
          understands how, like a craftsman, setting before himself as
          patterns the noblest men and words and deeds, to mould his own
          character to match them, and make his words resemble theirs. And if
          he should not wholly fall short of them, but should achieve even
          some slight resemblance, believe me that would be for him the
          greatest good fortune. And it is with this idea constantly before
          me that not only do I give myself a literary education by means of
          books, but even on my campaigns I never fail to carry them like
          necessary provisions. The number that I take with me is limited
          only by particular circumstances.)</p>

          a strain of eulogy if only in slight and unskilful phrases,
          composed in an unlearned and rustic fashion. For you would not say
          that a farmer showed proper feeling who, when starting to plant his
          vineyard, begs for cuttings from his neighbours, and presently,
          when he cultivates his vines, asks for a mattock and then for a
          hoe, and finally for a stake to which the vine must be tied and
          which it must lean against, so that it may itself be supported, and
          the bunches of grapes as they hang may nowhere touch the soil; and
          then, after obtaining all he asked for, drinks his fill of the
          pleasant gift of Dionysus, but does not share either the grapes or
          the must with those whom he found so willing to help him in his
          husbandry. Just so one would not say that a shepherd or neatherd or
          even a goatherd was honest and good and right-minded, who in
          winter, when his flocks need shelter and fodder, met with the
          utmost consideration from his friends, who helped him to procure
          many things, and gave him food in abundance, and lodging, and
          presently when spring and summer appeared, forgot in lordly fashion
          all those kindnesses, and shared neither his milk nor cheeses nor
          anything else with those who had saved his beasts for him when they
          would otherwise have perished.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(And now take
          the case of one who cultivates literature of any sort, and is
          himself young and therefore needs numerous guides and the abundant
          food and pure nourishment that is to be obtained from ancient
          writings, and then suppose that he should be deprived of all these
          all at once, is it, think you, slight assistance that he is asking?
          And is it slight payment that he deserves who comes to his aid? But
          perhaps he ought not even to attempt to make him any return for his
          zeal and kind actions? Perhaps he ought to imitate the famous
          Thales, that consummate philosopher, and that answer which we have
          all heard and which is so much admired? For when someone asked what
          fee he ought to pay him for knowledge he had acquired, Thales
          replied <span class="tei tei-q">“If you let it be known that it was
          I who taught you, you will amply repay me.”</span> Just so one who
          has not himself been the teacher, but has helped another in any way
          to gain knowledge, would indeed be wronged if he did not obtain
          gratitude and that acknowledgement of the gift which even the
          philosopher seems to have demanded. Well and good. But this gift of
          hers was both welcome and magnificent. And as for gold and silver I
          neither asked for them nor, were they in question, should I be
          willing thus to wear out your patience.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(But I wish to
          tell you a story very well worth your hearing, unless indeed you
          are already wearied by the length of this garrulous speech. Indeed
          it may be that you have listened without enjoyment to what has been
          said so far, seeing that the speaker is a layman and entirely
          ignorant of rhetoric, and knows neither how to invent nor how to
          use the writer's craft, but speaks the truth as it occurs to him.
          And my story is about something almost of the present time. Now
          many will say, I suppose, persuaded by the accomplished sophists,
          that I have collected what is trivial and worthless, and relate it
          to you as though it were of serious import. And probably they will
          say this, not because they are jealous of my speeches, or because
          they wish to rob me of the reputation that they may bring. For they
          well know that I do not desire to be their rival in the art by
          setting my own speeches against theirs, nor in any other way do I
          wish to quarrel with them. But since, for some reason or other,
          they are ambitious of speaking on lofty themes at any cost, they
          will not tolerate those who have not their ambition, and they
          reproach them with weakening the power of rhetoric. For they say
          that only those deeds are to be admired and are worthy of serious
          treatment and repeated praise which, because of their magnitude,
          have been thought by some to be incredible, those stories for
          instance about that famous woman<a id="noteref_592" name=

          flows through Babylon, and built a gorgeous palace underground, and
          then turned the stream back again beyond the dykes that she had
          made. For of her many a tale is told, how she fought a naval battle
          with three thousand ships, and on land she led into the field of
          battle three million hoplites, and in Babylon she built a wall very
          nearly five hundred stades in length, and the moat that surrounds
          the city and other very costly and expensive edifices were, they
          tell us, her work. And Nitocris<a id="noteref_594" name=

          and a crowd of women beyond number who played men's parts in no
          very seemly fashion occur to my mind. And some of them were
          conspicuous for their beauty and so became notorious, though it
          brought them no happiness, but since they were the causes of
          dissension and long wars among countless nations and as many men as
          could reasonably be collected from a country of that size, they are
          celebrated by the orators as having given rise to mighty deeds. And
          a speaker who has nothing of this sort to relate seems ridiculous
          because he makes no great effort to astonish his hearers or to
          introduce the marvellous into his speeches. Now shall we put this
          question to these orators, whether any one of them would wish to
          have a wife or daughter of that sort, rather than like Penelope?
          And yet in her case Homer had no more to tell than of her
          discretion and her love for her husband and the good care she took
          of her father-in-law and her son. Evidently she did not concern
          herself with the fields or the flocks, and as for leading an army
          or speaking in public, of course she never even dreamed of such a
          thing. But even when it was necessary for her to speak to the young
          suitors,)</p>

          Amazon's<a id="noteref_601" name="noteref_601" href=

          campaign and have filled all his poetry with tales of that sort,
          which certainly have a wonderful power to delight and charm. For as
          to the taking of the wall and the siege, and that battle near the
          ships which in some respects seems to have resembled a sea-fight,
          and then the fight of the hero and the river,<a id="noteref_602"
          name="noteref_602" href="#note_602"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">602</span></span></a> he
          did not bring them into this poem with the desire to relate
          something new and strange of his own invention. And even though
          this fight was, as they say, most marvellous, he neglected and
          passed over the marvellous as we see. What reason then can anyone
          give for his praising Penelope so enthusiastically and making not
          the slightest allusion to those famous women? Because by reason of
          her virtue and discretion many blessings have been gained for
          mankind, both for individuals and for the common weal, whereas from
          the ambition of those others there has arisen no benefit whatever,
          but incurable calamities. And so, as he was, I think, a wise and
          inspired poet, he decided that to praise Penelope was better and
          more just. And since I adopt so great a guide, is it fitting that I
          should be afraid lest some person think me trivial or
          inferior?)</p>

          how he had sailed round the Peloponnesus, while others spoke of his
          enactments, or of his rivalry with Cimon, who was reputed to be a
          most excellent citizen and a distinguished general. But Pericles
          gave no sign either of annoyance or exultation, and there was but
          one thing in all his political career for which he claimed to
          deserve praise, that, though he had governed the Athenian people
          for so long, he had been responsible for no man's death, and no
          citizen when he put on black clothes had ever said that Pericles
          was the cause of his misfortune. Now, by Zeus the god of
          friendship, do you think I need any further witness to testify that
          the greatest proof of virtue and one better worth praise than all
          the rest put together is not to have caused the death of any
          citizen, or to have taken his money from him, or involved him in
          unjust exile? But he who like a good physician tries to ward off
          such calamities as these, and by no means thinks that it is enough
          for him not to cause anyone to contract a disease, but unless he
          cures and cares for everyone as far as he can, considers that his
          work is unworthy of his skill, do you think that in justice such a
          one ought to receive no higher praise than Pericles? And shall we
          not hold in higher honour her character and that authority which
          enables her to do what she will, since what she wills is the good
          of all? For this I make the sum and substance of my whole encomium,
          though I do not lack other narratives such as are commonly held to
          be marvellous and splendid.)</p>

          the Emperor was on his campaign and had crossed the Rhine by
          bridges of boats near the frontiers of Galatia, is a false and vain
          invention. I could indeed very properly have given an account of
          this visit, and described how the people and the senate welcomed
          her with rejoicings and went to meet her with enthusiasm, and
          received her as is their custom to receive an Empress, and told the
          amount of the expenditure, how generous and splendid it was, and

          IV</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the fourth
          century <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> poetry was
          practically extinct, and hymns to the gods were almost always
          written in prose. Julian's Fourth Oration is, according to the
          definition of the rhetorician Menander, a φυσικὸς ὕμνος, a hymn
          that describes the physical qualities of a god. Julian was an
          uncritical disciple of the later Neo-Platonic school, and
          apparently reproduces without any important modification the
          doctrines of its chief representative, the Syrian Iamblichus, with
          whom begins the decadence of Neo-Platonism as a philosophy.
          Oriental superstition took the place of the severe spiritualism of
          Plotinus and his followers, and a philosophy that had been from the
          first markedly religious, is now expounded by theurgists and the
          devotees of strange Oriental cults. It is Mithras the Persian
          sun-god, rather than Apollo, whom Julian identifies with his
          <span class="tei tei-q">“intellectual god”</span> Helios, and
          Apollo plays a minor part among his manifestations. Mithras
          worship, which Tertullian called <span class="tei tei-q">“a Satanic
          plagiarism of Christianity,”</span> because in certain of its rites
          it recalled the sacraments of the Christian church, first made its
          appearance among the Romans in the first century <span class=

          at first than the cults of Isis and Serapis and the Great Mother of
          Pessinus, it gradually overpowered them and finally dominated the
          whole Roman Empire, though it was never welcomed by the Hellenes.
          For the Romans it supplied the ideals of purity, devotion and
          self-control which the other cults had lacked. The worshippers of
          Mithras were taught to contend against the powers of evil,
          submitted themselves to a severe moral discipline, and their reward
          after death was to become as pure as the gods to whom they ascend.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“If Christianity,”</span> says Renan,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“had been checked in its growth by some
          deadly disease, the world would have become Mithraic.”</span>
          Julian, like the Emperor Commodus in the second century, had no
          doubt been initiated into the Mysteries of Mithras, and the severe
          discipline of the cult was profoundly attractive to one who had
          been estranged by early associations from the very similar teaching
          of the Christians.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Julian followed
          Plotinus and Iamblichus in making the supreme principle the One
          (ἓν) or the Good (τὸ ἀγαθὸν) which presides over the intelligible
          world (νοητὸς κόσμος), where rule Plato's Ideas, now called the
          intelligible gods (νοητοὶ θεοί). Iamblichus had imported into the
          Neo-Platonic system the intermediary world of intellectual gods
          (νοεροὶ θεοί). On them Helios-Mithras, their supreme god and
          centre, bestows the intelligence and creative and unifying forces
          that he has received from his transcendental counterpart among the
          intelligible gods. The third member of the triad is the world of
          sense-perception governed by the sun, the visible counterpart of
          Helios. What distinguishes Julian's <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page350">[pg 350]</span><a name="Pg350" id="Pg350" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> triad<a id="noteref_610" name="noteref_610"
          href="#note_610"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">610</span></span></a> from
          other Neo-Platonic triads is this hierarchy of three suns in the
          three worlds: and further, the importance that he gives to the
          intermediary world, the abode of Helios-Mithras. He pays little
          attention to the remote intelligible world and devotes his
          exposition to Helios, the intellectual god, and the visible sun.
          Helios is the link that relates the three members of the triad. His
          <span class="tei tei-q">“middleness”</span> (μεσότης) is not only
          local: he is in every possible sense the mediator and unifier.
          μεσότης is the Aristotelian word for the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“mean,”</span> but there is no evidence that it was
          used with the active sense of mediation before Julian. A passage in
          Plutarch however seems to indicate that the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“middleness”</span> of the sun was a Persian doctrine:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“The principle of good most nearly
          resembles light, and the principle of evil darkness, and between
          both is Mithras; therefore the Persians called Mithras the
          Mediator”</span> (μεσίτης).<a id="noteref_611" name="noteref_611"
          href="#note_611"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">611</span></span></a>
          Naville has pointed out the resemblance between the sun as mediator
          and the Christian Logos, which Julian may have had in mind.
          Julian's system results in a practically monotheistic worship of
          Helios, and here he probably parts company with Iamblichus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But though
          deeply influenced by Mithraism, Julian was attempting to revive the
          pagan gods, and if he could not, in the fourth century, restore the
          ancient faith in the gods of Homer he nevertheless could not omit
          from his creed the numerous deities whose temples and altars he had
          rebuilt. Here he took advantage of the identification of Greek,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page351">[pg 351]</span><a name=
          "Pg351" id="Pg351" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Roman, and Oriental
          deities which had been going on for centuries. The old names,
          endeared by the associations of literature, could be retained
          without endangering the supremacy of Helios. Julian identifies
          Zeus, Helios, Hades, Oceanus and the Egyptian Serapis. But the
          omnipotent Zeus of Greek mythology is now a creative force which
          works with Helios and has no separate existence. Tradition had made
          Athene the child of Zeus, but Julian regards her as the
          manifestation of the intelligent forethought of Helios. Dionysus is
          the vehicle of his fairest thoughts, and Aphrodite a principle that
          emanates from him. He contrives that all the more important gods of
          Greece, Egypt and Persia shall play their parts as manifestations
          of Helios. The lesser gods are mediating demons as well as forces.
          His aim was to provide the Hellenic counterpart of the positive
          revealed religion of Christianity. Hence his insistence on the
          inspiration of Homer, Hesiod, and Plato, and his statement<a id=
          "noteref_612" name="noteref_612" href="#note_612"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">612</span></span></a> that
          the allegorical interpretations of the mysteries are not mere

          dedicated to his friend and comrade in arms Sallust who is probably
          identical with the Neo-Platonic philosopher, of the school of
          Iamblichus, who wrote about 360 the treatise <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">On the Gods and the

          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Against

          intelligence, but above all others it is of importance to myself.
          For I am a follower of King Helios. And of this fact I possess
          within me, known to myself alone, proofs more certain that I can
          give.<a id="noteref_621" name="noteref_621" href=

          this at least I am permitted to say without sacrilege, that from my
          childhood an extraordinary longing for the rays of the god
          penetrated deep into my soul; and from my earliest years my mind
          was so completely swayed by the light that illumines the heavens
          that not only did I desire to gaze intently at the sun, but
          whenever I walked abroad in the night season, when the firmament
          was clear and cloudless, I abandoned all else without exception and
          gave myself up to the beauties of the heavens; nor did I understand
          what anyone might say to me, nor heed what I was doing myself. I
          was considered to be over-curious about these matters and to pay
          too much attention to them, and people went so far as to regard me
          as an astrologer when my beard had only just begun to grow. And
          yet, I call heaven to witness, never had a book on this subject
          come into my hands; nor did I as yet even know what that science
          was. But why do I mention this, when I have more important things
          to tell, if I should relate how, in those days, I thought about the
          gods? However let that darkness<a id="noteref_622" name=
          "noteref_622" href="#note_622"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">622</span></span></a> be
          buried in oblivion. But let what I have said bear witness to this
          fact, that the heavenly light shone all about me, and that it
          roused and urged me on to its contemplation, so that even then I
          recognised of myself that the movement of the moon was in the
          opposite direction to the universe, though as yet I had met no one
          of those who are wise in these matters. Now for my part I envy the
          good fortune of any man to whom the god has granted to inherit a
          body built of the seed of holy and inspired ancestors, so that he
          can unlock the treasures of wisdom; nor do I despise that lot with
          which I was myself endowed by the god Helios, that I should be born
          of a house that rules and governs the world in my time; but
          further, I regard this god, if we may believe the wise, as the
          common father of all mankind.<a id="noteref_623" name="noteref_623"
          href="#note_623"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">623</span></span></a> For
          it is said with truth that man and the sun together beget man, and
          that the god sows this earth with souls which proceed not from
          himself alone but from the other gods also; and for what purpose,
          the souls reveal by the kind of lives that they select. Now far the
          best thing is when anyone has the fortune to have inherited the
          service of the god, even before the third generation, from a long
          and unbroken line of ancestors; yet it is not a thing to be
          disparaged when anyone, recognising that he is by nature intended
          to be the servant of Helios, either alone of all men, or in company
          with but few, devotes himself to the service of his master.)</p>

          stand by my side to aid me, and the Muses also and Apollo, the
          leader of the Muses, since he too has oratory for his province, and
          may they grant that I utter only what the gods approve that men
          should say and believe about them. What, then, shall be the manner
          of my praise? Or is it not evident that if I describe his substance

          lowest limit of the earth, is held together by the continuous

          imperishable for all time to come, and is guarded immediately by

          culmination is the beams of the sun; and in the second and higher
          degree, so to speak, by the intelligible world; but in a still
          loftier sense it is guarded by the King of the whole universe, who
          is the centre of all things that exist. He, therefore, whether it
          is right to call him the Supra-Intelligible, or the Idea of Being,
          and by Being I mean the whole intelligible region, or the One,
          since the One seems somehow to be prior to all the rest, or, to use
          Plato's name for him, the Good; at any rate this uncompounded cause
          of the whole reveals to all existence beauty, and perfection, and
          oneness, and irresistible power; and in virtue of the primal
          creative substance that abides in it, produced, as middle among the
          middle and intellectual, creative causes, Helios the most mighty
          god, proceeding from itself and in all things like unto itself.
          Even so the divine Plato believed, when he writes, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Therefore (said I) when I spoke of this, understand
          that I meant the offspring of the Good which the Good begat in his
          own likeness, and that what the Good is in relation to pure reason
          and its objects in the intelligible world, such is the sun in the
          visible world in relation to sight and its objects.”</span>
          Accordingly his light has the same relation to the visible world as
          truth has to the intelligible world. And he himself as a whole,
          since he is the son of what is first and greatest, namely, the Idea
          of the Good, and subsists from eternity in the region of its
          abiding substance, has received also the dominion among the
          intellectual gods, and himself dispenses to the intellectual gods
          those things of which the Good is the cause for the intelligible
          gods. Now the Good is, I suppose, the cause for the intelligible
          gods of beauty, existence, perfection, and oneness, connecting
          these and illuminating them with a power that works for good. These
          accordingly Helios bestows on the intellectual gods also, since he
          has been appointed by the Good to rule and govern them, even though
          they came forth and came into being together with him, and this
          was, I suppose, in order that the cause which resembles the Good
          may guide the intellectual gods to blessings for them all, and may
          regulate all things according to pure reason.)</p>

          just as many blessings as we said mighty Helios bestows on the
          intellectual gods. And of this there are clear proofs for one who
          studies the unseen world in the light of things seen. For in the
          first place, is not light itself a sort of incorporeal and divine
          form of the transparent in a state of activity? And as for the
          transparent itself, whatever it is, since it is the underlying
          basis, so to speak, of all the elements, and is a form peculiarly
          belonging to them, it is not like the corporeal or compounded, nor
          does it admit qualities peculiar to corporeal substance.<a id=
          "noteref_643" name="noteref_643" href="#note_643"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">643</span></span></a> You
          will not therefore say that heat is a property of the transparent,
          or its opposite cold, nor will you assign to it hardness or
          softness or any other of the various attributes connected with
          touch or taste or smell; but a nature of this sort is obvious to
          sight alone, since it is brought into activity by light. And light
          is a form of this substance, so to speak, which is the substratum
          of and coextensive with the heavenly bodies. And of light, itself
          incorporeal, the culmination and flower, so to speak, is the sun's
          rays. Now the doctrine of the Phoenicians, who were wise and
          learned in sacred lore, declared that the rays of light everywhere
          diffused are the undefiled incarnation of pure mind. And in harmony
          with this is our theory, seeing that light itself is incorporeal,
          if one should regard its fountainhead, not as corporeal, but as the
          undefiled activity of mind<a id="noteref_644" name="noteref_644"
          href="#note_644"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">644</span></span></a>
          pouring light into its own abode: and this is assigned to the
          middle of the whole firmament, whence it sheds its rays and fills
          the heavenly spheres with vigour of every kind and illumines all
          things with light divine and undefiled. Now the activities
          proceeding from it and exercised among the gods have been, in some
          measure at least, described by me a little earlier and will shortly
          be further spoken of. But all that we see merely with the sight at
          first is a name only, deprived of activity, unless we add thereto
          the guidance and aid of light. For what, speaking generally, could
          be seen, were it not first brought into touch with light in order
          that, I suppose, it may receive a form, as matter is brought under
          the hand of a craftsman? And indeed molten gold in the rough is
          simply gold, and not yet a statue or an image, until the craftsman
          give it its proper shape. So too all the objects of sight, unless
          they are brought under the eyes of the beholder together with
          light, are altogether deprived of visibility. Accordingly by giving
          the power of sight to those who see, and the power of being seen to
          the objects of sight, it brings to perfection, by means of a single
          activity, two faculties, namely vision and visibility.<a id=

          and day he creates, and before our eyes changes and sways the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(Let us
          therefore comprehend, out of all his functions, first his power to
          perfect, from the fact that he makes visible the objects of sight
          in the universe, for through his light he perfects them; secondly,
          his creative and generative power from the changes wrought by him
          in the universe; thirdly, his power to link together all things
          into one whole, from the harmony of his motions towards one and the
          same goal; fourthly, his middle station we can comprehend from
          himself, who is midmost; and fifthly, the fact that he is
          established as king among the intellectual gods, from his middle
          station among the planets. Now if we see that these powers, or
          powers of similar importance, belong to any one of the other
          visible deities, let us not assign to Helios leadership among the
          gods. But if he has nothing in common with those other gods except
          his beneficent energy, and of this too he gives them all a share,
          then let us call to witness the priests of Cyprus who set up common
          altars to Helios and Zeus; but even before them let us summon as
          witness Apollo, who sits in council with our god. For this god
          declares: <span class="tei tei-q">“Zeus, Hades, Helios Serapis,
          three gods in one godhead!”</span><a id="noteref_657" name=

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">657</span></span></a> Let
          us then assume that, among the intellectual gods, Helios and Zeus
          have a joint or rather a single sovereignty. Hence I think that
          with reason Plato called Hades a wise god.<a id="noteref_658" name=
          "noteref_658" href="#note_658"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">658</span></span></a> And
          we call this same god Hades Serapis also, namely the Unseen<a id=
          "noteref_659" name="noteref_659" href="#note_659"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">659</span></span></a> and
          Intellectual, to whom Plato says the souls of those who have lived
          most righteously and justly mount upwards. For let no one conceive
          of him as the god whom the legends teach us to shudder at, but as
          the mild and placable, since he completely frees our souls from
          generation: and the souls that he has thus freed he does not nail
          to other bodies, punishing them and exacting penalties, but he
          carries aloft and lifts up our souls to the intelligible world. And
          that this doctrine is not wholly new, but that Homer and Hesiod the
          most venerable of the poets held it before us, whether this was
          their own view or, like seers, they were divinely inspired with a
          sacred frenzy for the truth, is evident from the following. Hesiod,
          in tracing his genealogy, said<a id="noteref_660" name=
          "noteref_660" href="#note_660"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">660</span></span></a> that
          Helios is the son of Hyperion and Thea, intimating thereby that he
          is the true son of him who is above all things. For who else could
          Hyperion<a id="noteref_661" name="noteref_661" href=
          "#note_661"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">661</span></span></a> be?
          And is not Thea herself, in another fashion, said to be most divine
          of beings? But as for a union or marriage, let us not conceive of
          such a thing, since that is the incredible and paradoxical trifling
          of the poetic Muse. But let us believe that his father and sire was
          the most divine and supreme being; and who else could have this
          nature save him who transcends all things, the central point and
          goal of all things that exist? And Homer calls him Hyperion after
          his father and shows his unconditioned nature, superior to all
          constraint. For Zeus, as Homer says, since he is lord of all
          constrains the other gods. And when, in the course of the myth,
          Helios says that on account of the impiety of the comrades of
          Odysseus<a id="noteref_662" name="noteref_662" href=

          the earth contains being in a state of becoming. Then who endows it
          with imperishability? Is it not he<a id="noteref_666" name=

          keeps it all together by means of definite limits? For that the
          nature of being should be unlimited was not possible, since it is
          neither uncreated nor self-subsistent. And if from being something
          were generated absolutely without ceasing and nothing were resolved
          back into it, the substance of things generated would fail.
          Accordingly this god, moving in due measure, raises up and
          stimulates this substance when he approaches it, and when he
          departs to a distance he diminishes and destroys it; or rather he
          himself continually revivifies it by giving it movement and
          flooding it with life. And his departure and turning in the other
          direction is the cause of decay for things that perish. Ever does
          his gift of blessings descend evenly upon the earth. For now one
          country now another receives them, to the end that becoming may not
          cease nor the god ever benefit less or more than is his custom this
          changeful world. For sameness, as of being so also of activity,
          exists among the gods, and above all the others in the case of the
          King of the All, Helios; and he also makes the simplest movement of
          all the heavenly bodies<a id="noteref_667" name="noteref_667" href=
          "#note_667"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          travel in a direction opposite to the whole. In fact this is the
          very thing that the celebrated Aristotle makes a proof of his
          superiority, compared with the others. Nevertheless from the other
          intellectual gods also, forces clearly discernible descend to this
          world. And now what does this mean? Are we not excluding the others
          when we assert that the leadership has been assigned to Helios?
          Nay, far rather do I think it right from the visible to have faith
          about the invisible.<a id="noteref_668" name="noteref_668" href=
          "#note_668"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">668</span></span></a> For
          even as this god is seen to complete and to adapt to himself and to
          the universe the powers that are bestowed on the earth from the
          other gods for all things, after the same fashion we must believe
          that among the invisible gods also there is intercourse with one
          another; his mode of intercourse being that of a leader, while the
          modes of intercourse of the others are at the same time in harmony
          with his. For since we said that the god is established midmost
          among the midmost intellectual gods, may King Helios himself grant
          to us to tell what is the nature of that middleness among things of
          which we must regard him as the middle.)</p>

          which unifies and links together what is separate; for instance the
          sort of thing that Empedocles<a id="noteref_671" name="noteref_671"

          by Harmony when from it he altogether eliminates Strife. And now
          what does Helios link together, and of what is he the middle? I
          assert then that he is midway between the visible gods who surround
          the universe and the immaterial and intelligible gods who surround
          the Good—for the intelligible and divine substance is as it were
          multiplied without external influence and without addition. For
          that the intellectual and wholly beautiful substance of King Helios
          is middle in the sense of being unmixed with extremes, complete in
          itself, and distinct from the whole number of the gods, visible and
          invisible, both those perceptible by sense and those which are
          intelligible only, I have already declared, and also in what sense
          we must conceive of his middleness. But if I must also describe
          these things one by one, in order that we may discern with our
          intelligence how his intermediary nature, in its various forms, is
          related both to the highest and the lowest, even though it is not
          easy to recount it all, yet let me try to say what can be
          said.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(Wholly one is
          the intelligible world, pre-existent from all time, and it combines
          all things together in the One. Again is not our whole world also
          one complete living organism, wholly throughout the whole of it
          full of soul and intelligence, <span class="tei tei-q">“perfect,

          uniform two-fold perfection—I mean that one kind of unity holds
          together in one all that exists in the intelligible world, while
          the other kind of unity unites in the visible world all things into
          one and the same perfect nature—between these, I say, is the
          uniform perfection of King Helios, established among the
          intellectual gods. There is, however, next in order, a sort of
          binding force in the intelligible world of the gods, which orders
          all things into one. Again is there not visible in the heavens
          also, travelling in its orbit, the nature of the Fifth Substance,
          which links and compresses<a id="noteref_676" name="noteref_676"
          href="#note_676"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">676</span></span></a>
          together all the parts, holding together things that by nature are
          prone to scatter and to fall away from one another? These
          existences, therefore, which are two causes of connection, one in
          the intelligible world, while the other appears in the world of
          sense-perception, King Helios combines into one, imitating the
          synthetic power of the former among the intellectual gods, seeing
          that he proceeds from it, and subsisting prior to the latter which
          is seen in the visible world. Then must not the unconditioned also,
          which exists primarily in the intelligible world, and finally among
          the visible bodies in the heavens, possess midway between these two
          the unconditioned substance of King Helios, and from that primary
          creative substance do not the rays of his light, illumining all
          things, descend to the visible world? Again, to take another point
          of view, the creator of the whole is one, but many are the creative
          gods<a id="noteref_677" name="noteref_677" href=
          "#note_677"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">677</span></span></a> who
          revolve in the heavens. Midmost therefore of these also we must
          place the creative activity which descends into the world from
          Helios. But also the power of generating life is abundant and
          overflowing in the intelligible world; and our world also appears
          to be full of generative life. It is therefore evident that the
          life-generating power of King Helios also is midway between both
          the worlds: and the phenomena of our world also bear witness to
          this. For some forms he perfects, others he makes, or adorns, or
          wakes to life, and there is no single thing which, apart from the
          creative power derived from Helios, can come to light and to birth.
          And further, besides this, if we should comprehend the pure and
          undefiled and immaterial substance<a id="noteref_678" name=
          "noteref_678" href="#note_678"><span class=

          the intelligible gods—to which nothing external is added, nor has
          any alien thing a place therein, but it is filled with its own
          unstained purity—and if we should comprehend also the pure and
          unmixed nature of unstained and divine substance, whose elements
          are wholly unmixed, and which, in the visible universe, surrounds
          the substance that revolves,<a id="noteref_679" name="noteref_679"

          also we should discover the radiant and stainless substance of King
          Helios, midway between the two; that is to say, midway between the
          immaterial purity that exists among the intelligible gods, and that
          perfect purity, unstained and free from birth and death, that
          exists in the world which we can perceive. And the greatest proof
          of this is that not even the light which comes down nearest to the
          earth from the sun is mixed with anything, nor does it admit dirt
          and defilement, but remains wholly pure and without stain and free
          from external influences among all existing things.)</p>

          have already described many of them, I must set a seal, as it were,
          on this discourse, now that I am about to pass to other subjects
          that demand no less investigation. What then that seal is, and what
          is the knowledge of the god's substance that embraces all these
          questions, and as it were sums them up under one head, may he
          himself suggest to my mind, since I desire to describe in a brief
          summary both the cause from which he proceeded, and his own nature,
          and those blessings with which he fills the visible world. This
          then we must declare, that King Helios is One and proceeds from one
          god, even from the intelligible world which is itself One; and that
          he is midmost of the intellectual gods, stationed in their midst by
          every kind of mediateness that is harmonious and friendly, and that
          joins what is sundered; and that he brings together into one the
          last and the first, having in his own person the means of
          completeness, of connection, of generative life and of uniform
          being: and that for the world which we can perceive he initiates
          blessings of all sorts, not only by means of the light with which
          he illumines it, adorning it and giving it its splendour, but also
          because he calls into existence, along with himself, the substance
          of the Sun's angels; and that finally in himself he comprehends the
          ungenerated cause of things generated, and further, and prior to
          this, the ageless and abiding cause of the life of the imperishable

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(We must assume

          his powers.<a id="noteref_689" name="noteref_689" href=
          "#note_689"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">689</span></span></a> For
          it cannot be that a god's substance is one thing, and his power
          another, and his activity, by Zeus, a third thing besides these.
          For all that he wills he is, and can do, and puts into action. For
          he does not will what is not, nor does he lack power to do what he
          wills, nor does he desire to put into action what he cannot. In the
          case of a human being, however, this is otherwise. For his is a
          two-fold contending nature of soul and body compounded into one,
          the former divine, the latter dark and clouded. Naturally,
          therefore, there is a battle and a feud between them. And Aristotle
          also says that this is why neither the pleasures nor the pains in
          us harmonise with one another. For he says that what is pleasant to
          one of the natures within us is painful to the nature which is its
          opposite. But among the gods there is nothing of this sort. For
          from their very nature what is good belongs to them, and
          perpetually, not intermittently. In the first place, then, all that
          I said when I tried to show forth his substance, I must be
          considered to have said about his powers and activities also. And
          since in such cases the argument is naturally convertible, all that
          I observe next in order concerning his powers and activities must
          be considered to apply not to his activities only, but to his
          substance also. For verily there are gods related to Helios and of
          like substance who sum up the stainless nature of this god, and
          though in the visible world they are plural, in him they are one.
          And now listen first to what they assert who look at the heavens,
          not like horses and cattle, or some other unreasoning and ignorant
          animal,<a id="noteref_690" name="noteref_690" href=

          from it draw their conclusions about the unseen world. But even
          before this, if you please, consider his supra-mundane powers and
          activities, and out of a countless number, observe but a few.)</p>

          substance throughout as one, since he brings together its extremes.

          the link that binds together the extremes, would one not reasonably
          suppose that, in the case of the cause which is separate from
          elements and prior to them—and though it is the principle of
          generation, is not itself generation—it is so ordered that, in that
          world also, the extreme causes which are wholly separate from
          elements are bound together into one through certain modes of
          mediation, by King Helios, and are united about him as their
          centre? And the creative power of Zeus also coincides with him, by
          reason of which in Cyprus, as I said earlier, shrines are founded
          and assigned to them in common. And Apollo himself also we called
          to witness to our statements, since it is certainly likely that he
          knows better than we about his own nature. For he too abides with
          Helios and is his colleague by reason of the singleness of his
          thoughts and the stability of his substance and the consistency of
          his activity.)</p>

          in the region, that is to say, of the absolute causes which,
          separated from visible creation, existed prior to it; secondly we

          the genuine son of the Good and from it has received his blessed
          lot in fulness of perfection, he himself distributes that
          blessedness to the intellectual gods, bestowing on them a
          beneficent and perfect nature. This then is one of his works. And a
          second work of the god is his most perfect distribution of
          intelligible beauty among the intellectual and immaterial forms.

          to bring forth offspring, it is further necessary that it should be
          guided by the substance that, in the region of intelligible beauty,
          does this very thing eternally and always and not intermittently,
          now fruitful now barren. For all that is beautiful in our world
          only at times, is beautiful always in the intelligible world. We
          must therefore assert that the ungenerated offspring in beauty
          intelligible and eternal guides the generative cause in the visible
          world; which offspring<a id="noteref_702" name="noteref_702" href=

          called into existence and keeps at his side, and to it he assigns
          also perfect reason. For just as through his light he gives sight
          to our eyes, so also among the intelligible gods through his
          intellectual counterpart—which he causes to shine far more brightly
          than his rays in our upper air—he bestows, as I believe, on all the
          intellectual gods the faculty of thought and of being comprehended
          by thought. Besides these, another marvellous activity of Helios
          the King of the All is that by which he endows with superior lot
          the nobler races—I mean angels, daemons,<a id="noteref_704" name=

          remain in the category of model and archetype and never give
          themselves over to bodies. I have now described the substance of
          our god that is prior to the world and his powers and activities,
          celebrating Helios the King of the All in so far as it was possible
          for me to compass his praise. But since eyes, as the saying goes,
          are more trustworthy than hearing—although they are of course less
          trustworthy and weaker than the intelligence—come, let me endeavour
          to tell also of his visible creative function; but let first me
          entreat him to grant that I speak with some measure of
          success.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(From eternity
          there subsisted, surrounding Helios, the visible world, and from
          eternity the light that encompasses the world has its fixed
          station, not shining intermittently, nor in different ways at
          different times, but always in the same manner. And if one desired
          to comprehend, as far as the mind may, this eternal nature from the
          point of view of time, one would understand most easily of how many
          blessings for the world throughout eternity he is the cause, even
          Helios the King of the All who shines without cessation. Now I am
          aware that the great philosopher Plato,<a id="noteref_708" name=
          "noteref_708" href="#note_708"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">708</span></span></a> and
          after him a man who, though he is later in time, is by no means
          inferior to him in genius—I mean Iamblichus<a id="noteref_709"
          name="noteref_709" href="#note_709"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">709</span></span></a> of
          Chalcis, who through his writings initiated me not only into other
          philosophic doctrines but these also—I am aware, I say, that they
          employed as a hypothesis the conception of a generated world, and
          assumed for it, so to speak, a creation in time in order that the
          magnitude of the works that arise from Helios might be recognised.
          But apart from the fact that I fall short altogether of their
          ability, I must by no means be so rash; especially since the
          glorious hero Iamblichus thought it was not without risk to assume,
          even as a bare hypothesis, a temporal limit for the creation of the
          world. Nay rather, the god came forth from an eternal cause, or
          rather brought forth all things from everlasting, engendering by
          his divine will and with untold speed and unsurpassed power, from
          the invisible all things now visible in present time. And then he
          assigned as his own station the mid-heavens, in order that from all
          sides he may bestow equal blessings on the gods who came forth by
          his agency and in company with him; and that he may guide the seven
          spheres<a id="noteref_710" name="noteref_710" href=
          "#note_710"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          yes and as I believe the ninth creation too, namely our world which
          revolves for ever in a continuous cycle of birth and death. For it
          is evident that the planets, as they dance in a circle about him,
          preserve as the measure of their motion a harmony between this god
          and their own movements such as I shall now describe; and that the
          whole heaven also, which adapts itself to him in all its parts, is
          full of gods who proceed from Helios. For this god is lord of five
          zones in the heavens; and when he traverses three of these he
          begets in those three the three Graces.<a id="noteref_712" name=

          the remaining zones are the scales of mighty Necessity.<a id=

          the Greeks what I say is perhaps incomprehensible—as though one
          were obliged to say to them only what is known and familiar. Yet
          not even is this altogether strange to them as one might suppose.
          For who, then, in your opinion, are the Dioscuri,<a id=
          "noteref_714" name="noteref_714" href="#note_714"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">714</span></span></a> O ye
          most wise, ye who accept without question so many of your
          traditions? Do you not call them <span class="tei tei-q">“alternate
          of days,”</span> because they may not both be seen on the same day?
          It is obvious that by this you mean <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“yesterday”</span> and <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“to-day.”</span> But what does this mean, in the name
          of those same Dioscuri? Let me apply it to some natural object, so
          that I may not say anything empty and senseless. But no such object
          could one find, however carefully one might search for it. For the
          theory that some have supposed to be held by the theogonists, that
          the two hemispheres of the universe are meant, has no meaning. For
          how one could call each one of the hemispheres <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“alternate of days”</span> is not easy to imagine,
          since the increase of their light in each separate day is
          imperceptible. But now let us consider a question on which some may
          think that I am innovating. We say correctly that those persons for
          whom the time of the sun's course above the earth is the same in
          one and the same month share the same day. Consider therefore
          whether the expression <span class="tei tei-q">“alternate of
          days”</span> cannot be applied both to the tropics and the other,
          the polar, circles. But some one will object that it does not apply
          equally to both. For though the former are always visible, and both
          of them are visible at once to those who inhabit that part of the
          earth where shadows are cast in an opposite direction,<a id=

          in the case of the latter those who see the one do not see the
          other.)</p>

          their statues. And it is Dionysus who is the giver of the Graces,
          and in this very connection he is said to reign with Helios. Why

          of the other names of gods, which all belong to Helios? For from
          his works men have learned to know this god, who makes the whole
          heavens perfect through the gift of intellectual blessings, and
          gives it a share of intelligible beauty; and taking the heavens as
          their starting-point, they have learned to know him both as a whole
          and his parts also, from his abundant bestowal of good gifts. For
          he exercises control over all movement, even to the lowest plane of
          the universe. And everywhere he makes all things perfect, nature
          and soul and everything that exists. And marshalling together this
          great army of the gods into a single commanding unity, he handed it
          over to Athene Pronoia<a id="noteref_728" name="noteref_728" href=
          "#note_728"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">728</span></span></a> who,
          as the legend says, sprang from the head of Zeus, but I say that
          she was sent forth from Helios whole from the whole of him, being
          contained within him; though I disagree with the legend only so far
          as I assert that she came forth not from his highest part, but
          whole from the whole of him. For in other respects, since I believe
          that Zeus is in no wise different from Helios, I agree with that
          ancient tradition. And in using this very phrase Athene Pronoia, I
          am not innovating, if I rightly understand the words:)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(—by Zeus, that
          is to say, who is identical with Helios? And just as King Apollo,
          through the singleness of his thoughts, is associated with Helios,
          so also we must believe that Athene<a id="noteref_735" name=

          received her nature from Helios, and that she is his intelligence
          in perfect form: and so she binds together the gods who are
          assembled about Helios and brings them without confusion into unity
          with Helios, the King of the All: and she distributes and is the
          channel for stainless and pure life throughout the seven spheres,
          from the highest vault of the heavens as far as Selene the
          Moon:<a id="noteref_736" name="noteref_736" href=
          "#note_736"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">736</span></span></a> for
          Selene is the last of the heavenly spheres which Athene fills with
          wisdom: and by her aid Selene beholds the intelligible which is
          higher than the heavens, and adorns with its forms the realm of
          matter that lies below her, and thus she does away with its
          savagery and confusion and disorder. Moreover to mankind Athene
          gives the blessings of wisdom and intelligence and the creative
          arts. And surely she dwells in the capitols of cities because,
          through her wisdom, she has established the community of the state.
          I have still to say a few words about Aphrodite, who, as the wise
          men among the Phoenicians affirm, and as I believe, assists Helios
          in his creative function. She is, in very truth, a synthesis of the
          heavenly gods, and in their harmony she is the spirit of love and
          unity.<a id="noteref_737" name="noteref_737" href=
          "#note_737"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          she<a id="noteref_738" name="noteref_738" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">738</span></span></a> is
          very near to Helios, and when she pursues the same course as he and
          approaches him, she fills the skies with fair weather and gives
          generative power to the earth: for she herself takes thought for
          the continuous birth of living things. And though of that
          continuous birth King Helios is the primary creative cause, yet
          Aphrodite is the joint cause with him, she who enchants our souls
          with her charm and sends down to earth from the upper air rays of
          light most sweet and stainless, aye, more lustrous than gold
          itself. I desire to mete out to you still more of the theology of
          the Phoenicians, and whether it be to some purpose my argument as
          it proceeds will show. The inhabitants of Emesa,<a id="noteref_739"

          place from time immemorial sacred to Helios, associate with Helios

          Iamblichus, from whom I have taken this and all besides, a little
          from a great store, says that the secret meaning to be interpreted
          is that Monimos is Hermes and Azizos Ares, the assessors of Helios,
          who are the channel for many blessings to the region of our
          earth.)</p>

          unites into one, about his own undivided substance, a great
          multitude of the gods: and further, I demonstrated that among the
          gods whom we can perceive, who revolve eternally in their most
          blessed path, he is leader and lord; since he bestows on their
          nature its generative power, and fills the whole heavens not only
          with visible rays of light but with countless other blessings that
          are invisible; and, further, that the blessings which are
          abundantly supplied by the other visible gods are made perfect by
          him, and that even prior to this the visible gods themselves are
          made perfect by his unspeakable and divine activity. In the same
          manner we must believe that on this our world of generation certain
          gods have alighted who are linked together with Helios: and these
          gods guide the four-fold nature of the elements, and inhabit,
          together with the three higher races,<a id="noteref_744" name=

          of how many blessings is he the cause! For he extends to them the
          faculty of judging, and guides them with justice, and purifies them
          by his brilliant light. Again, does he not set in motion the whole
          of nature and kindle life therein, by bestowing on it generative
          power from on high? But for the divided natures also, is not he the
          cause that they journey to their appointed end?<a id="noteref_746"

          Aristotle says that man is begotten by man and the sun together.
          Accordingly the same theory about King Helios must surely apply to
          all the other activities of the divided souls. Again, does he not
          produce for us rain and wind and the clouds in the skies, by
          employing, as though it were matter, the two kinds of vapour? For
          when he heats the earth he draws up steam and smoke, and from these
          there arise not only the clouds but also all the physical changes
          on our earth, both great and small.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(But why do I
          deal with the same questions at such length, when I am free at last
          to come to my goal, though not till I have first celebrated all the
          blessings that Helios has given to mankind? For from him are we
          born, and by him are we nourished. But his more divine gifts, and
          all that he bestows on our souls when he frees them from the body
          and then lifts them up on high to the region of those substances
          that are akin to the god; and the fineness and vigour of his divine
          rays, which are assigned as a sort of vehicle for the safe descent
          of our souls into this world of generation; all this, I say, let
          others celebrate in fitting strains, but let me believe it rather
          than demonstrate its truth. However, I need not hesitate to discuss
          so much as is known to all. Plato says that the sky is our
          instructor in wisdom. For from its contemplation we have learned to
          know the nature of number, whose distinguishing characteristics we
          know only from the course of the sun. Plato himself says that day
          and night were created first.<a id="noteref_750" name="noteref_750"
          href="#note_750"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">750</span></span></a> And
          next, from observing the moon's light, which was bestowed on the
          goddess by Helios, we later progressed still further in the
          understanding of these matters: in every case conjecturing the
          harmony of all things with this god. For Plato himself says
          somewhere that our race was by nature doomed to toil, and so the
          gods pitied us and gave us Dionysus and the Muses as playfellows.
          And we recognised that Helios is their common lord, since he is
          celebrated as the father of Dionysus and the leader of the Muses.
          And has not Apollo, who is his colleague in empire, set up oracles
          in every part of the earth, and given to men inspired wisdom, and
          regulated their cities by means of religious and political
          ordinances? And he has civilised the greater part of the world by
          means of Greek colonies, and so made it easier for the world to be
          governed by the Romans. For the Romans themselves not only belong
          to the Greek race, but also the sacred ordinances and the pious
          belief in the gods which they have established and maintain are,
          from beginning to end, Greek. And beside this they have established
          a constitution not inferior to that of any one of the best governed
          states, if indeed it be not superior to all others that have ever
          been put into practice. For which reason I myself recognise that
          our city is Greek, both in descent and as to its constitution.)</p>

          the saviour of the whole world? and how he bestowed on us every
          kind of excellence by sending down to us Aphrodite together with
          Athene, and thus laid down for our protection what is almost a law,
          that we should only unite to beget our kind? Surely it is for this
          reason that, in agreement with the course of the sun, all plants
          and all the tribes of living things are aroused to bring forth
          their kind. What need is there for me to glorify his beams and his
          light? For surely everyone knows how terrible is night without a
          moon or stars, so that from this he can calculate how great a boon
          for us is the light of the sun? And this very light he supplies at
          night, without ceasing, and directly, from the moon in those upper
          spaces where it is needed, while he grants us through the night a
          truce from toil. But there would be no limit to the account if one
          should endeavour to describe all his gifts of this sort. For there
          is no single blessing in our lives which we do not receive as a
          gift from this god, either perfect from him alone, or, through the
          other gods, perfected by him.)</p>

          Palatine Hill, and Helios himself under this name of his which is
          commonly known to all and familiar to all. And I could say much to
          prove that we, the sons of Romulus and Aeneas, are in every way and
          in all respects connected with him, but I will mention briefly only
          what is most familiar. According to the legend, Aeneas is the son
          of Aphrodite, who is subordinate to Helios and is his kinswoman.
          And the tradition has been handed down that the founder of our city
          was the son of Ares, and the paradoxical element in the tale has
          been believed because of the portents which later appeared to
          support it. For a she-wolf, they say, gave him suck. Now I am aware
          that Ares, who is called Azizos by the Syrians who inhabit Emesa,
          precedes Helios in the sacred procession, but I mentioned it
          before, so I think I may let that pass. But why is the wolf sacred
          only to Ares and not to Helios? Yet men call the period of a year

          me to bring forward a still greater proof that the founder of our
          city was sent down to earth, not by Ares alone, though perhaps some
          noble daemon with the character of Ares did take part in the
          fashioning of his mortal body, even he who is said to have visited

          the whole truth is that the soul of the god Quirinus<a id=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">762</span></span></a> came
          down to earth from Helios; for we must, I think, believe the sacred
          tradition. And the close conjunction of Helios and Selene, who
          share the empire over the visible world, even as it had caused his
          soul to descend to earth, in like manner caused to mount upwards
          him whom it received back from the earth, after blotting out with
          fire from a thunderbolt<a id="noteref_763" name="noteref_763" href=

          mortal part of his body. So clearly did she who creates earthly
          matter, she whose place is at the furthest point below the sun,
          receive Quirinus when he was sent down to earth by Athene, goddess
          of Forethought; and when he took flight again from earth she led
          him back straightway to Helios, the King of the All.)</p>

          the undying flame of the sun at different hours in turn; they guard
          the fire that is produced on earth by the agency of the god. And I
          can tell you a still greater proof of the power of this god, which
          is the work of that most divine king himself. The months are
          reckoned from the moon by, one may say, all other peoples; but we
          and the Egyptians alone reckon the days of every year according to
          the movements of the sun. If after this I should say that we also
          worship Mithras, and celebrate games in honour of Helios every four
          years, I shall be speaking of customs that are somewhat
          recent.<a id="noteref_768" name="noteref_768" href=
          "#note_768"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">768</span></span></a> But
          perhaps it is better to cite a proof from the remote past. The
          beginning of the cycle of the year is placed at different times by
          different peoples. Some place it at the spring equinox, others at
          the height of summer, and many in the late autumn; but they each
          and all sing the praises of the most visible gifts of Helios. One
          nation celebrates the season best adapted for work in the fields,
          when the earth bursts into bloom and exults, when all the crops are
          just beginning to sprout, and the sea begins to be safe for
          sailing; and the disagreeable, gloomy winter puts on a more
          cheerful aspect, others again award the crown to the summer
          season,<a id="noteref_769" name="noteref_769" href=
          "#note_769"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">769</span></span></a> since
          at that time they can safely feel confidence about the yield of the
          fruits, when the grains have already been harvested and midsummer
          is now at its height, and the fruits on the trees are ripening.
          Others again, with still more subtlety, regard as the close of the
          year the time when all the fruits are in their perfect prime and
          decay has already set in. For this reason they celebrate the annual
          festival of the New Year in late autumn. But our forefathers, from
          the time of the most divine king Numa, paid still greater reverence
          to the god Helios. They ignored the question of mere utility, I
          think, because they were naturally religious and endowed with
          unusual intelligence; but they saw that he is the cause of all that
          is useful, and so they ordered the observance of the New Year to
          correspond with the present season; that is to say when King Helios
          returns to us again, and leaving the region furthest south and,
          rounding Capricorn as though it were a goal-post, advances from the
          south to the north to give us our share of the blessings of the
          year. And that our forefathers, because they comprehended this
          correctly, thus established the beginning of the year, one may
          perceive from the following. For it was not, I think, the time when
          the god turns, but the time when he becomes visible to all men, as
          he travels from south to north, that they appointed for the
          festival. For still unknown to them was the nicety of those laws
          which the Chaldæans and Egyptians discovered, and which
          Hipparchus<a id="noteref_770" name="noteref_770" href=
          "#note_770"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          perfected: but they judged simply by sense-perception, and were
          limited to what they could actually see.)</p>

          praise and to celebrate with sacrifice! And above all the others
          may Helios himself, the King of the All, grant me this, even he who
          from eternity has proceeded from the generative substance of the
          Good: even he who is midmost of the midmost intellectual gods; who
          fills them with continuity and endless beauty and superabundance of
          generative power and perfect reason, yea with all blessings at
          once, and independently of time! And now he illumines his own
          visible abode, which from eternity moves as the centre of the whole
          heavens, and bestows a share of intelligible beauty on the whole
          visible world, and fills the whole heavens with the same number of
          gods as he contains in himself in intellectual form. And without
          division they reveal themselves in manifold form surrounding him,
          but they are attached to him to form a unity. Aye, but also,
          through his perpetual generation and the blessings that he bestows
          from the heavenly bodies, he holds together the region beneath the
          moon. For he cares for the whole human race in common, but
          especially for my own city,<a id="noteref_775" name="noteref_775"

          as also he brought into being my soul from eternity, and made it
          his follower. All this, therefore, that I prayed for a moment ago,
          may he grant, and further may he, of his grace, endow my city as a
          whole with eternal existence, so far as is possible, and protect
          her; and for myself personally, may he grant that, so long as I am
          permitted to live, I may prosper in my affairs both human and
          divine; finally may he grant me to live and serve the state with my
          life, so long as is pleasing to himself and well for me and

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">780</span></span></a> was
          not wholly worthless. But if you wish to meet with a more complete
          and more mystical treatment of the same theme, then read the
          writings of the inspired Iamblichus on this subject,<a id=
          "noteref_781" name="noteref_781" href="#note_781"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          you will find there the most consummate wisdom which man can
          achieve. And may mighty Helios grant that I too may attain to no
          less perfect knowledge of himself, and that I may instruct all men,
          speaking generally, but especially those who are worthy to learn.
          And so long as Helios grants let us all in common revere
          Iamblichus, the beloved of the gods. For he is the source for what
          I have here set down, a few thoughts from many, as they occurred to
          my mind. However I know well that no one can utter anything more
          perfect than he, nay not though he should labour long at the task
          and say very much that is new. For he will naturally diverge
          thereby from the truest knowledge of the god. Therefore it would
          probably have been a vain undertaking to compose anything after
          Iamblichus on the same subject if I had written this discourse for
          the sake of giving instruction. But since I wished to compose a
          hymn to express my gratitude to the god, I thought that this was
          the best place in which to tell, to the best of my power, of his
          essential nature. And so I think that not in vain has this
          discourse been composed. For the saying)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The cult of
          Phrygian Cybele the Mother of the Gods, known to the Latin world as
          the Great Mother, Magna Mater, was the first Oriental religion
          adopted by the Romans. In the Fifth Oration, which is, like the
          Fourth, a hymn, Julian describes the entrance of the Goddess into
          Italy in the third century <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> In Greece she had
          been received long before, but the more civilised Hellenes had not
          welcomed, as did the Romans, the more barbarous features of the
          cult, the mutilated priests, the Galli, and the worship of
          Attis.<a id="noteref_783" name="noteref_783" href=
          "#note_783"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">783</span></span></a> They
          preferred the less emotional cult of the Syrian Adonis. In Athens
          the Mother of the Gods was early identified with Gaia the Earth
          Mother, and the two became inextricably confused.<a id=
          "noteref_784" name="noteref_784" href="#note_784"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">784</span></span></a> But
          Julian, in this more Roman than Greek, does not shrink from the
          Oriental conception of Cybele as the lover of Attis, attended by
          eunuch priests, or the frenzy of renunciation described by
          Catullus.<a id="noteref_785" name="noteref_785" href=
          "#note_785"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">785</span></span></a> But
          he was first of all a Neo-Platonist, and the aim of this hymn as of
          the Fourth Oration is to adapt to his philosophy a popular cult and
          to give its Mysteries a philosophic interpretation.</p><span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page440">[pg 440]</span><a name="Pg440" id="Pg440"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Mithraic
          religion, seeking to conciliate the other cults of the empire, had
          from the first associated with the sun-god the worship of the Magna
          Mater, and Attis had been endowed with the attributes of Mithras.
          Though Julian's hymn is in honour of Cybele he devotes more
          attention to Attis. Originally the myth of Cybele symbolises the
          succession of the seasons; the disappearance of Attis the sun-god
          is the coming of winter; his mutilation is the barrenness of nature
          when the sun has departed; his restoration to Cybele is the renewal
          of spring. In all this he is the counterpart of Persephone among
          the Greeks and of Adonis in Syria. Julian interprets the myth in
          connection with the three worlds described in the Fourth Oration.
          Cybele is a principle of the highest, the intelligible world, the
          source of the intellectual gods. Attis is not merely a sun-god: he
          is a principle of the second, the intellectual world, who descends
          to the visible world in order to give it order and fruitfulness.
          Julian expresses the Neo-Platonic dread and dislike of matter, of
          the variable, the plural and unlimited. Cybele the intelligible
          principle would fain have restrained Attis the embodiment of
          intelligence from association with matter. His recall and
          mutilation symbolise the triumph of unity over multiformity, of
          mind over matter. His restoration to Cybele symbolises the escape
          of our souls from the world of generation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Julian follows

          regarding the myths as allegories to be interpreted by the
          philosopher and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page441">[pg

          the theosophist. They are riddles to be solved, and the paradoxical
          element in them is designed to turn our minds to the hidden truth.
          For laymen the myth is enough. Like all the Neo-Platonists he
          sometimes uses phrases which imply human weakness or chronological
          development for his divinities and then withdraws those phrases,
          explaining that they must be taken in another sense. His attitude
          to myths is further defined in the Sixth<a id="noteref_787" name=

          Seventh Orations. The Fifth Oration can hardly be understood apart
          from the Fourth, and both must present many difficulties to a
          reader who is unfamiliar with Plotinus, Porphyry, the treatise
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">On the

          what is the manner of their ritual of purification? And further why
          was it introduced in the beginning among us Romans? It was handed
          down by the Phrygians in very ancient times, and was first taken
          over by the Greeks, and not by any ordinary Greeks but by Athenians
          who had learned by experience that they did wrong to jeer at one
          who was celebrating the Mysteries of the Mother. For it is said
          that they wantonly insulted and drove out Gallus, on the ground
          that he was introducing a new cult, because they did not understand
          what sort of goddess they had to do with, and that she was that
          very Deo whom they worship, and Rhea and Demeter too. Then followed
          the wrath of the goddess and the propitiation of her wrath. For the
          priestess of the Pythian god who guided the Greeks in all noble
          conduct, bade them propitiate the wrath of the Mother of the Gods.
          And so, we are told, the Metroum was built, where the Athenians
          used to keep all their state records.<a id="noteref_797" name=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">797</span></span></a> After
          the Greeks the Romans took over the cult, when the Pythian god had
          advised them in their turn to bring the goddess from Phrygia as an
          ally for their war against the Carthaginians.<a id="noteref_798"

          perhaps there is no reason why I should not insert here a brief
          account of what happened. When they learned the response of the
          oracle, the inhabitants of Rome, that city beloved of the gods,
          sent an embassy to ask from the kings of Pergamon<a id=
          "noteref_799" name="noteref_799" href="#note_799"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">799</span></span></a> who
          then ruled over Phrygia and from the Phrygians themselves the most
          holy statue<a id="noteref_800" name="noteref_800" href=
          "#note_800"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">800</span></span></a> of
          the goddess. And when they had received it they brought back their
          most sacred freight, putting it on a broad cargo-boat which could
          sail smoothly over those wide seas. Thus she crossed the Aegean and
          Ionian Seas, and sailed round Sicily and over the Etruscan Sea, and
          so entered the mouth of the Tiber. And the people and the Senate
          with them poured out of the city, and in front of all the others
          there came to meet her all the priests and priestesses in suitable
          attire according to their ancestral custom. And in excited suspense
          they gazed at the ship as she ran before a fair wind, and about her
          keel they could discern the foaming wake as she cleft the waves.
          And they greeted the ship as she sailed in and adored her from
          afar, everyone where he happened to be standing. But the goddess,
          as though she desired to show the Roman people that they were not
          bringing a lifeless image from Phrygia, but that what they had
          received from the Phrygians and were now bringing home possessed
          greater and more divine powers than an image, stayed the ship
          directly she touched the Tiber, and she was suddenly as though
          rooted in mid-stream. So they tried to tow her against the current,
          but she did not follow. Then they tried to push her off, thinking
          they had grounded on a shoal, but for all their efforts she did not
          move. Next every possible device was brought to bear, but in spite
          of all she remained immovable. Thereupon a terrible and unjust
          suspicion fell on the maiden who had been consecrated to the most
          sacred office of priestess, and they began to accuse Claudia<a id=
          "noteref_801" name="noteref_801" href="#note_801"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">801</span></span></a>—for
          that was the name of that noble maiden<a id="noteref_802" name=
          "noteref_802" href="#note_802"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">802</span></span></a>—of
          not having kept herself stainless and pure for the goddess;
          wherefore they said that the goddess was angry and was plainly
          declaring her wrath. For by this time the thing seemed to all to be
          supernatural. Now at first she was filled with shame at the mere
          name of the thing and the suspicion; so very far was she from such
          shameless and lawless behaviour. But when she saw that the charge
          against her was gaining strength, she took off her girdle and
          fastened it about the prow of the ship, and, like one divinely
          inspired, bade all stand aside: and then she besought the goddess
          not to suffer her to be thus implicated in unjust slanders. Next,
          as the story goes, she cried aloud as though it were some nautical
          word of command, <span class="tei tei-q">“O Goddess Mother, if I am
          pure follow me!”</span> And lo, she not only made the ship move,
          but even towed her for some distance up stream. Two things, I
          think, the goddess showed the Romans on that day: first that the
          freight they were bringing from Phrygia had no small value, but was
          priceless, and that this was no work of men's hands but truly
          divine, not lifeless clay but a thing possessed of life and divine
          powers. This, I say, was one thing that the goddess showed them.
          And the other was that no one of the citizens could be good or bad
          and she not know thereof. Moreover the war of the Romans against
          the Carthaginians forthwith took a favourable turn, so that the
          third war was waged only for the walls of Carthage itself.<a id=

          that nature which is last in order, and through its superabundance
          of generative power descends even unto our earth through the upper
          region from the stars,—this is he whom we seek, even Attis. But
          perhaps I ought to distinguish more clearly what I mean. We assert
          that matter exists and also form embodied in matter. But if no
          cause be assigned prior to these two, we should be introducing,
          unconsciously, the Epicurean doctrine. For if there be nothing of
          higher order than these two principles, then a spontaneous motion
          and chance brought them together. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“But,”</span> says some acute Peripatetic like
          Xenarchus, <span class="tei tei-q">“we see that the cause of these
          is the fifth or cyclic substance. Aristotle is absurd when he
          investigates and discusses these matters, and Theophrastus
          likewise. At any rate he overlooked the implications of a
          well-known utterance of his. For just as when he came to
          incorporeal and intelligible substance he stopped short and did not
          inquire into its cause, and merely asserted that this is what it is
          by nature; surely in the case of the fifth substance also he ought
          to have assumed that its nature is to be thus; and he ought not to
          have gone on to search for causes, but should have stopped at
          these, and not fallen back on the intelligible, which has no
          independent existence by itself, and in any case represents a bare
          supposition.”</span> This is the sort of thing that Xenarchus says,
          as I remember to have heard. Now whether what he says is correct or
          not, let us leave to the extreme Peripatetics to refine upon. But
          that his view is not agreeable to me is, I think, clear to
          everyone. For I hold that the theories of Aristotle himself are
          incomplete unless they are brought into harmony with those of
          Plato<a id="noteref_809" name="noteref_809" href=

          rather we must make these also agree with the oracles that have
          been vouchsafed to us by the gods.)</p>

          contain the incorporeal causes of the forms that are embodied in
          matter. For that, apart from these causes, it is not possible for
          generation to take place is, I think, clear and manifest. For why
          are there so many kinds of generated things? Whence arise masculine
          and feminine? Whence the distinguishing characteristics of things
          according to their species in well-defined types, if there are not
          pre-existing and pre-established concepts, and causes which existed
          beforehand to serve as a pattern?<a id="noteref_815" name=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">815</span></span></a> And
          if we discern these causes but dimly, let us still further purify
          the eyes of the soul. And the right kind of purification is to turn
          our gaze inwards and to observe how the soul and embodied Mind are
          a sort of mould<a id="noteref_816" name="noteref_816" href=
          "#note_816"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">816</span></span></a> and
          likeness of the forms that are embodied in matter. For in the case
          of the corporeal, or of things that though incorporeal come into
          being and are to be studied in connection with the corporeal, there
          is no single thing whose mental image the mind cannot grasp
          independently of the corporeal. But this it could not have done if
          it did not possess something naturally akin to the incorporeal
          forms. Indeed it is for this reason that Aristotle himself called
          the soul the <span class="tei tei-q">“place of the
          forms,”</span><a id="noteref_817" name="noteref_817" href=
          "#note_817"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">817</span></span></a> only
          he said that the forms are there not actually but potentially. Now
          a soul of this sort, that is allied with matter, must needs possess
          these forms potentially only, but a soul that should be independent
          and unmixed in this way we must believe would contain all the
          concepts, not potentially but actually. Let us make this clearer by
          means of the example which Plato himself employed in the Sophist,
          with reference certainly to another theory, but still he did employ
          it. And I bring forward the illustration, not to prove my argument;
          for one must not try to grasp it by demonstration, but only by
          apprehension. For it deals with the first causes, or at least those
          that rank with the first, if indeed, as it is right to believe, we
          must regard Attis also as a god. What then, and of what sort is
          this illustration? Plato says that, if any man whose profession is
          imitation desire to imitate in such a way that the original is
          exactly reproduced, this method of imitation is troublesome and
          difficult, and, by Zeus, borders on the impossible; but pleasant
          and easy and quite possible is the method which only seems to
          imitate real things. For instance, when we take up a mirror and
          turn it round we easily get an impression of all objects, and show
          the general outline of every single thing. From this example let us
          go back to the analogy I spoke of, and let the mirror stand for
          what Aristotle calls the <span class="tei tei-q">“place of the
          forms”</span> potentially.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(Now the forms
          themselves must certainly subsist actually before they subsist
          potentially. If, therefore, the soul in us, as Aristotle himself
          believed, contains potentially the forms of existing things, where
          shall we place the forms in that previous state of actuality? Shall
          it be in material things? No, for the forms that are in them are
          evidently the last and lowest. Therefore it only remains to search
          for immaterial causes which exist in actuality prior to and of a
          higher order than the causes that are embodied in matter. And our
          souls must subsist in dependence on these and come forth together
          with them, and so receive from them the concepts of the forms, as
          mirrors show the reflections of things; and then with the aid of
          nature it bestows them on matter and on these material bodies of
          our world. For we know that nature is the creator of bodies,
          universal nature in some sort of the All; while that the individual
          nature of each is the creator of particulars is plainly evident.
          But nature exists in us in actuality without a mental image,
          whereas the soul, which is superior to nature, possesses a mental
          image besides. If therefore we admit that nature contains in
          herself the cause of things of which she has however no mental
          image, why, in heaven's name, are we not to assign to the soul
          these same forms, only in a still higher degree, and with priority
          over nature, seeing that it is in the soul that we recognise the
          forms by means of mental images, and comprehend them by means of
          the concept? Who then is so contentious as to admit on the one hand
          that the concepts embodied in matter exist in nature—even though
          not all and equally in actuality, yet all potentially—while on the
          other hand he refuses to recognise that the same is true of the
          soul? If therefore the forms exist in nature potentially, but not
          actually, and if also they exist potentially in the soul,<a id=

          in a still purer sense and more completely separated, so that they
          can be comprehended and recognised; but yet exist in actuality
          nowhere at all; to what, I ask, shall we hang the chain of
          perpetual generation, and on what shall we base our theories of the
          imperishability of the universe? For the cyclic substance<a id=
          "noteref_824" name="noteref_824" href="#note_824"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">824</span></span></a>
          itself is composed of matter and form. It must therefore follow
          that, even though in actuality these two, matter and form, are
          never separate from one another, yet for our intelligence the forms
          must have prior existence and be regarded as of a higher order.
          Accordingly, since for the forms embodied in matter a wholly
          immaterial cause has been assigned, which leads these forms under
          the hand of the third creator<a id="noteref_825" name="noteref_825"
          href="#note_825"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">825</span></span></a>—who
          for us is the lord and father not only of these forms but also of
          the visible fifth substance—from that creator we distinguish Attis,
          the cause which descends even unto matter, and we believe that
          Attis or Gallus is a god of generative powers. Of him the myth
          relates that, after being exposed at birth near the eddying stream
          of the river Gallus, he grew up like a flower, and when he had
          grown to be fair and tall, he was beloved by the Mother of the
          Gods. And she entrusted all things to him, and moreover set on his
          head the starry cap.<a id="noteref_826" name="noteref_826" href=
          "#note_826"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">826</span></span></a> But
          if our visible sky covers the crown of Attis, must one not
          interpret the river Gallus as the Milky Way?<a id="noteref_827"
          name="noteref_827" href="#note_827"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">827</span></span></a> For
          it is there, they say, that the substance which is subject to
          change mingles with the passionless revolving sphere of the fifth
          substance. Only as far as this did the Mother of the Gods permit
          this fair intellectual god Attis, who resembles the sun's rays, to
          leap and dance. But when he passed beyond this limit and came even
          to the lowest region, the myth said that he had descended into the
          cave, and had wedded the nymph. And the nymph is to be interpreted
          as the dampness of matter; though the myth does not here mean
          matter itself, but the lowest immaterial cause which subsists prior
          to matter. Indeed Heracleitus also says:)</p>

          enthroned at the side of Zeus, and in very truth is the Mother of
          all the Gods. For having received into herself the causes of all
          the gods, both intelligible and supra-mundane, she became the
          source of the intellectual gods. Now this goddess, who is also
          Forethought, was inspired with a passionless love for Attis. For
          not only the forms embodied in matter, but to a still greater
          degree the causes of those forms, voluntarily serve her and obey
          her will. Accordingly the myth relates the following: that she who
          is the Providence who preserves all that is subject to generation
          and decay, loved their creative and generative cause, and commanded
          that cause to beget offspring rather in the intelligible region;
          and she desired that it should turn towards herself and dwell with
          her, but condemned it to dwell with no other thing. For only thus
          would that creative cause strive towards the uniformity that
          preserves it, and at the same time would avoid that which inclines
          towards matter. And she bade that cause look towards her, who is
          the source of the creative gods, and not be dragged down or allured
          into generation. For in this way was mighty Attis destined to be an
          even mightier creation, seeing that in all things the conversion to
          what is higher produces more power to effect than the inclination
          to what is lower. And the fifth substance itself is more creative
          and more divine than the elements of our earth, for this reason,
          that it is more nearly connected with the gods. Not that anyone,
          surely, would venture to assert that any substance, even if it be
          composed of the purest aether, is superior to soul undefiled and
          pure, that of Heracles for instance, as it was when the creator
          sent it to earth. For that soul of his both seemed to be and was
          more effective than after it had bestowed itself on a body. Since
          even Heracles, now that he has returned, one and indivisible, to
          his father one and indivisible, more easily controls his own
          province than formerly when he wore the garment of flesh and walked
          among men. And this shows that in all things the conversion to the
          higher is more effective than the propensity to the lower. This is
          what the myth aims to teach us when it says that the Mother of the
          Gods exhorted Attis not to leave her or to love another. But he
          went further, and descended even to the lowest limits of matter.
          Since, however, it was necessary that his limitless course should
          cease and halt at last, mighty Helios the Corybant,<a id=

          shares the Mother's throne and with her creates all things, with

          persuaded the Lion<a id="noteref_844" name="noteref_844" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">844</span></span></a> to
          reveal the matter. And who is the Lion? Verily we are told that he
          is flame-coloured.<a id="noteref_845" name="noteref_845" href=
          "#note_845"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">845</span></span></a> He
          is, therefore, the cause that subsists prior to the hot and fiery,
          and it was his task to contend against the nymph and to be jealous
          of her union with Attis. (And who the nymph is, I have said.) And
          the myth says that the Lion serves the creative Providence of the
          world, which evidently means the Mother of the Gods. Then it says
          that by detecting and revealing the truth, he caused the youth's
          castration. What is the meaning of this castration? It is the
          checking of the unlimited. For now was generation confined within
          definite forms checked by creative Providence. And this would not
          have happened without the so-called madness of Attis, which
          overstepped and transgressed due measure, and thereby made him
          become weak so that he had no control over himself. And it is not
          surprising that this should come to pass, when we have to do with
          the cause that ranks lowest among the gods. For consider the fifth
          substance, which is subject to no change of any sort, in the region
          of the light of the moon: I mean where our world of continuous
          generation and decay borders on the fifth substance. We perceive
          that in the region of her light it seems to undergo certain
          alterations and to be affected by external influences. Therefore it
          is not contradictory to suppose that our Attis also is a sort of
          demigod—for that is actually the meaning of the myth—or rather for
          the universe he is wholly god, for he proceeds from the third
          creator, and after his castration is led upwards again to the
          Mother of the Gods. But though he seems to lean and incline towards
          matter, one would not be mistaken in supposing that, though he is
          the lowest in order of the gods, nevertheless he is the leader of
          all the tribes of divine beings. But the myth calls him a demigod
          to indicate the difference between him and the unchanging gods. He
          is attended by the Corybants who are assigned to him by the Mother;
          they are the three leading personalities of the higher races<a id=
          "noteref_846" name="noteref_846" href="#note_846"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">846</span></span></a> that
          are next in order to the gods. Also Attis rules over the lions, who
          together with the Lion, who is their leader, have chosen for
          themselves hot and fiery substance, and so are, first and foremost,
          the cause of fire. And through the heat derived from fire they are
          the causes of motive force and of preservation for all other things
          that exist. And Attis encircles the heavens like a tiara, and
          thence sets out as though to descend to earth.)</p>

          concealment and disappearance and descent into the cave. In proof
          of this let me cite the time of year at which it happens. For we
          are told that the sacred tree<a id="noteref_849" name="noteref_849"
          href="#note_849"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          on the third day the sacred and unspeakable member of the god
          Gallus is severed.<a id="noteref_852" name="noteref_852" href=

          comes, they say, the Hilaria<a id="noteref_853" name="noteref_853"

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">853</span></span></a> and
          the festival. And that this castration, so much discussed by the
          crowd, is really the halting of his unlimited course, is evident
          from what happens directly mighty Helios touches the cycle of the
          equinox, where the bounds are most clearly defined. (For the even
          is bounded, but the uneven is without bounds, and there is no way
          through or out of it.) At that time then, precisely, according to
          the account we have, the sacred tree is felled. Thereupon, in their
          proper order, all the other ceremonies take place. Some of them are
          celebrated with the secret ritual of the Mysteries, but others by a
          ritual that can be told to all. For instance, the cutting of the
          tree belongs to the story of Gallus and not to the Mysteries at
          all, but it has been taken over by them, I think because the gods
          wished to teach us, in symbolic fashion, that we must pluck the
          fairest fruits from the earth, namely, virtue and piety, and offer
          them to the goddess to be the symbol of our well-ordered
          constitution here on earth. For the tree grows from the soil, but
          it strives upwards as though to reach the upper air, and it is fair
          to behold and gives us shade in the heat, and casts before us and
          bestows on us its fruits as a boon; such is its superabundance of
          generative life. Accordingly the ritual enjoins on us, who by
          nature belong to the heavens but have fallen to earth, to reap the
          harvest of our constitution here on earth, namely, virtue and
          piety, and then strive upwards to the goddess of our forefathers,
          to her who is the principle of all life.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(Therefore,
          immediately after the castration, the trumpet sounds the recall for
          Attis and for all of us who once flew down from heaven and fell to
          earth. And after this signal, when King Attis stays his limitless
          course by his castration, the god bids us also root out the
          unlimited in ourselves and imitate the gods our leaders and hasten
          back to the defined and uniform, and, if it be possible, to the One
          itself. After this, the Hilaria must by all means follow. For what
          could be more blessed, what more joyful than a soul which has
          escaped from limitlessness and generation and inward storm, and has
          been translated up to the very gods? And Attis himself was such a
          one, and the Mother of the Gods by no means allowed him to advance
          unregarded further than was permitted: nay, she made him turn
          towards herself, and commanded him to set a limit to his limitless
          course.)</p>

          our ancestors in every case tried to trace the original meanings of
          things, whether with the guidance of the gods or
          independently—though perhaps it would be better to say that they
          sought for them under the leadership of the gods—then when they had
          discovered those meanings they clothed them in paradoxical myths.
          This was in order that, by means of the paradox and the
          incongruity, the fiction might be detected and we might be induced
          to search out the truth. Now I think ordinary men derive benefit
          enough from the irrational myth which instructs them through

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(For it is
          evident that Attis of whom I speak, who wears the tiara set with
          stars, took for the foundation of his own dominion the functions of
          every god as we see them applied to the visible world. And in his
          case all is undefiled and pure as far as the Milky Way. But, at
          this very point, that which is troubled by passion begins to mingle
          with the passionless, and from that union matter begins to subsist.
          And so the association of Attis with matter is the descent into the
          cave, nor did this take place against the will of the gods and the
          Mother of the Gods, though the myth says that it was against their
          will. For by their nature the gods dwell in a higher world, and the
          higher powers do not desire to drag them hence down to our world:
          rather through the condescension of the higher they desire to lead
          the things of our earth upwards to a higher plane more favoured by
          the gods. And in fact the myth does not say that the Mother of the
          Gods was hostile to Attis after his castration: but it says that
          though she is no longer angry, she was angry at the time on account
          of his condescension, in that he who was a higher being and a god
          had given himself to that which was inferior. But when, after
          staying his limitless progress, he has set in order the chaos of
          our world through his sympathy with the cycle of the equinox, where
          mighty Helios controls the most perfect symmetry of his motion
          within due limits, then the goddess gladly leads him upwards to
          herself, or rather keeps him by her side. And never did this happen
          save in the manner that it happens now; but forever is Attis the
          servant and charioteer of the Mother; forever he yearns
          passionately towards generation; and forever he cuts short his
          unlimited course through the cause whose limits are fixed, even the
          cause of the forms. In like manner the myth says that he is led
          upwards as though from our earth, and again resumes his ancient
          sceptre and dominion: not that he ever lost it, or ever loses it
          now, but the myth says that he lost it on account of his union with
          that which is subject to passion and change.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(But perhaps it
          is worth while to raise the following question also. There are two
          equinoxes, but men pay more honour to the equinox in the sign of
          Capricorn than to that in the sign of Cancer.<a id="noteref_862"
          name="noteref_862" href="#note_862"><span class=

          Surely the reason for this is evident. Since the sun begins to
          approach us immediately after the spring equinox,—for I need not
          say that then the days begin to lengthen,—this seemed the more
          agreeable season. For apart from the explanation which says that
          light accompanies the gods, we must believe that the uplifting
          rays<a id="noteref_863" name="noteref_863" href=
          "#note_863"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">863</span></span></a> of
          the sun are nearly akin to those who yearn to be set free from
          generation. Consider it clearly: the sun, by his vivifying and
          marvellous heat, draws up all things from the earth and calls them
          forth and makes them grow; and he separates, I think, all corporeal
          things to the utmost degree of tenuity, and makes things weigh
          light that naturally have a tendency to sink. We ought then to make
          these visible things proofs of his unseen powers. For if among
          corporeal things he can bring this about through his material heat,
          how should he not draw and lead upwards the souls of the blessed by
          the agency of the invisible, wholly immaterial, divine and pure
          substance which resides in his rays? We have seen then that this
          light is nearly akin to the god, and to those who yearn to mount
          upwards, and moreover, that this light increases in our world, so
          that when Helios begins to enter the sign of Capricorn the day
          becomes longer than the night. It has also been demonstrated that
          the god's rays are by nature uplifting; and this is due to his
          energy, both visible and invisible, by which very many souls have
          been lifted up out of the region of the senses, because they were
          guided by that sense which is clearest of all and most nearly like
          the sun. For when with our eyes we perceive the sun's light, not
          only is it welcome and useful for our lives, but also, as the
          divine Plato said when he sang its praises, it is our guide to
          wisdom. And if I should also touch on the secret teaching of the
          Mysteries in which the Chaldean,<a id="noteref_864" name=

          divinely frenzied, celebrated the God of the Seven Rays, that god
          through whom he lifts up the souls of men, I should be saying what
          is unintelligible, yea wholly unintelligible to the common herd,

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(I was saying
          that we ought not to suppose that the ancients appointed the season
          of the rites irrationally, but rather as far as possible with
          plausible and true grounds of reason; and indeed a proof of this is
          that the goddess herself chose as her province the cycle of the
          equinox. For the most holy and secret Mysteries of Deo and the
          Maiden<a id="noteref_869" name="noteref_869" href=
          "#note_869"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          celebrated when the sun is in the sign of Libra, and this is quite
          natural. For when the gods depart we must consecrate ourselves
          afresh, so that we may suffer no harm from the godless power of
          darkness that now begins to get the upper hand. At any rate the
          Athenians celebrate the Mysteries of Deo twice in the year, and the
          Lesser Mysteries as they call them in the sign of Capricorn, and
          the Great Mysteries when the sun is in the sign of Cancer, and this
          for the reason that I have just mentioned. And I think that these
          Mysteries are called Great and Lesser for several reasons, but
          especially, as is natural, they are called great when the god
          departs rather than when he approaches; and so the Lesser are
          celebrated only by way of reminder.<a id="noteref_870" name=
          "noteref_870" href="#note_870"><span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">870</span></span></a> I
          mean that when the saving and uplifting god approaches, the
          preliminary rites of the Mysteries take place. Then a little later
          follow the rites of purification, one after another, and the
          consecration of the priests. Then when the god departs to the
          antipodes, the most important ceremonies of the Mysteries are
          performed, for our protection and salvation. And observe the
          following: As in the festival of the Mother the instrument of
          generation is severed, so too with the Athenians, those who take
          part in the secret rites are wholly chaste and their leader the
          hierophant forswears generation; because he must not have aught to
          do with the progress to the unlimited, but only with the substance
          whose bounds are fixed, so that it abides for ever and is contained
          in the One, stainless and pure. On this subject I have said
          enough.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(It only remains
          now to speak, as is fitting, about the sacred rite itself, and the
          purification, so that from these also I may borrow whatever
          contributes to my argument. For example, everyone thinks that the
          following is ridiculous. The sacred ordinance allows men to eat
          meat, but it forbids them to eat grains and fruits. What, say they,
          are not the latter lifeless, whereas the former was once possessed
          of life? Are not fruits pure, whereas meat is full of blood and of
          much else that offends eye and ear? But most important of all is it
          not the case that, when one eats fruit nothing is hurt, while the
          eating of meat involves the sacrifice and slaughter of animals who
          naturally suffer pain and torment? So would say many even of the
          wisest. But the following ordinance is ridiculed by the most
          impious of mankind also. They observe that whereas vegetables that
          grows upwards can be eaten, roots are forbidden, turnips, for
          instance; and they point out that figs are allowed, but not
          pomegranates or apples either. I have often heard many men saying
          this in whispers, and I too in former days have said the same, but
          now it seems that I alone of all men am bound to be deeply grateful
          to the ruling gods, to all of them, surely, but above all the rest
          to the Mother of the Gods. For all things am I grateful to her, and
          for this among the rest, that she did not disregard me when I
          wandered as it were in darkness.<a id="noteref_874" name=

          first she bade me cut off no part indeed of my body, but by the aid
          of the intelligible cause<a id="noteref_875" name="noteref_875"
          href="#note_875"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          subsists prior to our souls, all that was superfluous and vain in
          the impulses and motions of my own soul. And that cause gave me, to
          aid my understanding, certain beliefs which are perhaps not wholly
          out of harmony with the true and sacred knowledge of the gods. But
          it looks as though, not knowing what to say next, I were turning
          round in a circle. I can, however, give clear and manifest reasons
          in every single case why we are not allowed to eat this food which
          is forbidden by the sacred ordinance, and presently I will do this.
          But for the moment it is better to bring forward certain forms, so
          to speak, and regulations which we must observe in order to be able
          to decide about these matters, though perhaps, owing to my haste,
          my argument may pass some evidence by.)</p>

          descends to the lowest limits and is checked by the creative motion
          of the sun so soon as that god reaches the exactly limited circuit

          the end and aim of the rite of purification is the ascent of our

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(For this reason
          then the ordinance forbids us first to eat those fruits that grow
          downwards in the earth. For the earth is the last and lowest of
          things. And Plato also says<a id="noteref_882" name="noteref_882"

          evil, exiled from the gods, now moves on earth; and in the oracles
          the gods often call the earth refuse, and exhort us to escape
          thence. And so, in the first place, the life-generating god who is
          our providence does not allow us to use to nourish our bodies
          fruits that grow under the earth; and thereby enjoins that we turn
          our eyes towards the heavens, or rather above the heavens.<a id=
          "noteref_883" name="noteref_883" href="#note_883"><span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">883</span></span></a> One
          kind of fruit of the earth, however, some people do eat, I mean
          fruit in pods, because they regard this as a vegetable rather than
          a fruit, since it grows with a sort of upward tendency and is
          upright, and not rooted below the soil; I mean that it is rooted
          like the fruit of the ivy that hangs on a tree or of the vine that
          hangs on a stem. For this reason then we are forbidden to eat seeds
          and certain plants, but we are allowed to eat fruit and vegetables,
          only not those that creep on the ground, but those that are raised
          up from the earth and hang high in the air. It is surely for this
          reason that the ordinance bids us also avoid that part of the
          turnip which inclines to the earth since it belongs to the under
          world, but allows us to eat that part which grows upwards and
          attains to some height, since by that very fact it is pure. In fact
          it allows us to eat any vegetables that grow upwards, but forbids
          us roots, and especially those which are nourished in and
          influenced by the earth. Moreover in the case of trees it does not
          allow us to destroy and consume apples, for these are sacred and
          golden and are the symbols of secret and mystical rewards. Rather
          are they worthy to be reverenced and worshipped for the sake of
          their archetypes. And pomegranates are forbidden because they
          belong to the under-world; and the fruit of the date-palm, perhaps
          one might say because the date-palm does not grow in Phrygia where
          the ordinance was first established. But my own theory is rather
          that it is because this tree is sacred to the sun, and is
          perennial, that we are forbidden to use it to nourish our bodies
          during the sacred rites. Besides these, the use of all kinds of
          fish is forbidden. This is a question of interest to the Egyptians
          as well as to ourselves. Now my opinion is that for two reasons we
          ought to abstain from fish, at all times if possible, but above all
          during the sacred rites. One reason is that it is not fitting that
          we should eat what we do not use in sacrifices to the gods. And
          perhaps I need not be afraid that hereupon some greedy person who
          is the slave of his belly will take me up, though as I remember
          that very thing happened to me once before; and then I heard
          someone objecting: <span class="tei tei-q">“What do you mean? Do we
          not often sacrifice fish to the gods?”</span> But I had an answer
          ready for this question also. <span class="tei tei-q">“My good
          sir,”</span> I said, <span class="tei tei-q">“it is true that we
          make offerings of fish in certain mystical sacrifices, just as the
          Romans sacrifice the horse and many other animals too, both wild
          and domesticated, and as the Greeks and the Romans too sacrifice
          dogs to Hecate. And among other nations also many other animals are
          offered in the mystic cults; and sacrifices of that sort take place
          publicly in their cities once or twice a year. But that is not the
          custom in the sacrifices which we honour most highly, in which
          alone the gods deign to join us and to share our table. In those
          most honoured sacrifices we do not offer fish, for the reason that
          we do not tend fish, nor look after the breeding of them, and we do
          not keep flocks of fish as we do of sheep and cattle. For since we
          foster these animals and they multiply accordingly, it is only
          right that they should serve for all our uses and above all for the
          sacrifices that we honour most.”</span> This then is one reason why
          I think we ought not to use fish for food at the time of the rite
          of purification. The second reason which is, I think, even more in
          keeping with what I have just said, is that, since fish also, in a
          manner of speaking, go down into the lowest depths, they, even more
          than seeds, belong to the under-world. But he who longs to take
          flight upwards and to mount aloft above this atmosphere of ours,
          even to the highest peaks of the heavens, would do well to abstain
          from all such food. He will rather pursue and follow after things
          that tend upwards towards the air, and strive to the utmost height,
          and, if I may use a poetic phrase, look upward to the skies. Birds,
          for example, we may eat, except only those few which are commonly
          held sacred,<a id="noteref_884" name="noteref_884" href=
          "#note_884"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">884</span></span></a> and
          ordinary four-footed animals, except the pig. This animal is banned
          as food during the sacred rites because by its shape and way of
          life, and the very nature of its substance—for its flesh is impure
          and coarse—it belongs wholly to the earth. And therefore men came
          to believe that it was an acceptable offering to the gods of the
          under-world. For this animal does not look up at the sky, not only
          because it has no such desire, but because it is so made that it
          can never look upwards. These then are the reasons that have been
          given by the divine ordinance for abstinence from such food as we
          ought to renounce. And we who comprehend share our knowledge with
          those who know the nature of the gods.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(And to the
          question what food is permitted I will only say this. The divine
          law does not allow all kinds of food to all men, but takes into
          account what is possible to human nature and allows us to eat most
          animals, as I have said. It is not as though we must all of
          necessity eat all kinds—for perhaps that would not be
          convenient—but we are to use first what our physical powers allow;
          secondly, what is at hand in abundance; thirdly, we are to exercise
          our own wills. But at the season of the sacred ceremonies we ought
          to exert those wills to the utmost so that we may attain to what is
          beyond our ordinary physical powers, and thus may be eager and
          willing to obey the divine ordinances. For it is by all means more
          effective for the salvation of the soul itself that one should pay
          greater heed to its safety than to the safety of the body. And
          moreover the body too seems thereby to share insensibly in that
          great and marvellous benefit. For when the soul abandons herself
          wholly to the gods, and entrusts her own concerns absolutely to the
          higher powers, and then follow the sacred rites—these too being
          preceded by the divine ordinances—then, I say, since there is
          nothing to hinder or prevent—for all things reside in the gods, all
          things subsist in relation to them, all things are filled with the
          gods—straightway the divine light illumines our souls. And thus
          endowed with divinity they impart a certain vigour and energy to
          the breath<a id="noteref_888" name="noteref_888" href=
          "#note_888"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">888</span></span></a>
          implanted in them by nature; and so that breath is hardened as it
          were and strengthened by the soul, and hence gives health to the
          whole body. For I think not one of the sons of Asclepios would deny
          that all diseases, or at any rate very many and those the most
          serious, are caused by the disturbance and derangement of the
          breathing. Some doctors assert that all diseases, others that the
          greater number and the most serious and hardest to cure, are due to
          this. Moreover the oracles of the gods bear witness thereto, I mean
          that by the rite of purification not the soul alone but the body as
          well is greatly benefited and preserved. Indeed the gods when they
          exhort those theurgists who are especially holy, announce to them
          that their <span class="tei tei-q">“mortal husk of raw
          matter”</span><a id="noteref_889" name="noteref_889" href=

          left for me to say? Especially since it was granted me to compose
          this hymn at a breath, in the short space of one night, without
          having read anything on the subject beforehand, or thought it over.
          Nay, I had not even planned to speak thereof until the moment that
          I asked for these writing-tablets. May the goddess bear witness to
          the truth of my words! Nevertheless, as I said before, does there
          not still remain for me to celebrate the goddess in her union with
          Athene and Dionysus? For the sacred law established their festivals
          at the very time of her sacred rites. And I recognise the kinship
          of Athene and the Mother of the Gods through the similarity of the
          forethought that inheres in the substance of both goddesses. And I
          discern also the divided creative function of Dionysus, which great
          Dionysus received from the single and abiding principle of life
          that is in mighty Zeus. For from Zeus he proceeded, and he bestows
          that life on all things visible, controlling and governing the
          creation of the whole divisible world. Together with these gods we
          ought to celebrate Hermes Epaphroditus.<a id="noteref_892" name=

          so this god is entitled by the initiated who say that he kindles
          the torches for wise Attis. And who has a soul so dense as not to
          understand that through Hermes and Aphrodite are invoked all
          generated things everywhere, since they everywhere and throughout
          have a purpose which is peculiarly appropriate to the Logos?<a id=

          is not this Logos Attis, who not long ago was out of his senses,
          but now through his castration is called wise? Yes, he was out of
          his senses because he preferred matter and presides over
          generation, but he is wise because he adorned and transformed this
          refuse, our earth, with such beauty as no human art or cunning
          could imitate. But how shall I conclude my discourse? Surely with

              takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to
              meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit
              donations in locations where we have not received written

              originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of
              electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For
              thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg™
              eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project
              Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
              editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by
              copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included.
              Thus, we do not necessarily keep ebooks in compliance with any
              particular paper edition.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Each ebook
              is in a subdirectory of the same number as the ebook's ebook
              number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
              compressed (zipped), HTML and others.</p>

              "font-style: italic">editions</span></em> of our ebooks replace
              the old file and take over the old filename and etext number.
              The replaced older file is renamed. <em class=
